<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p>These essays being mainly the outcome of direct personal
impressions of certain works of art and literature,
and of the places in which they were produced, I have
but few acknowledgments to make to the authors of
books treating of the same subject. Among the exceptions
to this rule, I must mention foremost Professor
Tocco's <i>Eresia nel Medio Evo</i>, Monsieur Gebhart's <i>Italie
Mystique</i>, and Monsieur Paul Sabatier's <i>St. Fran&ccedil;ois
d'Assise</i>.</p>

<p>I am, on the other hand, very deeply indebted to
the conversation and advice of certain among my
friends, for furnishing me second-hand a little of that
arch&aelig;ological and critical knowledge which is now-a-days
quite unattainable save by highly trained specialists.
My best thanks, therefore, to Miss Eug&eacute;nie
Sellers, editor of Furtw&auml;ngler's "Masterpieces of Greek
Sculpture;" to Mr. Bernhard Berenson, author of
"Venetian Painters," and a monograph on Lorenzo
Lotto; and particularly to my friend Mrs. Mary
Logan, whose learned catalogue of the Italian paintings
at Hampton Court is sufficient warrant for the correctness
of my art-historical statements, which she has
had the kindness to revise.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>"Panis Angelicus fit panis hominum. O res mirabilis,
manducat Dominum Pauper, Servus et Humilis." These
words of the Matins of the Most Holy Sacrament I
heard for the first time many years ago, to the beautiful
and inappropriate music of Cherubini. They struck
me at that time as foolish, barbarous, and almost gross;
but since then I have learned to think of them, and in
a measure to feel of them, as of something greater and
more solemn than all the music that Cherubini ever
wrote.</p>

<p>All the hymns of the same date are, indeed, things
to think upon. They affect one&mdash;the "Stabat Mater,"
for instance, and the "Ave Verum"&mdash;very much in
the same way as the figures which stare down, dingy
green and blue, from the gold of the Cosmati's mosaics:
childish, dreary, all stiff and agape, but so solemn and
pathetic, and full of the greatest future. For out of those
Cosmati mosaics, and those barbarous frescoes of the
old basilicas, will come Giotto and all the Renaissance;
and out of those Church songs will come Dante; they
are all signs, poor primitive rhymes and primitive
figures, that the world is teeming again, and will <ins title="original has bare">bear</ins>,
for centuries to come, new spiritual wonders. Hence
the importance, the venerableness of all those medi&aelig;val
hymns. But of none so much, to my mind, as of those
words I have quoted from the Matins of the Most Holy
Sacrament&mdash;</p>

<p>For their crude and pathetic literality, their image
of the Godhead actually giving Himself, as they emphatically
say, to be <i>chewed</i> by the poor and humble
man and the serf, show them to have been most
especially born, abortions though they be, in the
mightiest throes of mystical feeling, after the incubation
of whole nations, born of the great medi&aelig;val
marriage, sublime, grotesque, morbid, yet health-bringing,
between abstract idealising religious thought and
the earthly affections of lovers and parents&mdash;a strange
marriage, like that of St. Francis and Poverty, of which
the modern soul also had to be born anew.</p>

<p>Indeed, if we realise in the least what this hymn
must have meant, shouted in the processions of
Flagellants, chaunted in the Pacts of Peace after
internecine town wars; above all, perhaps, muttered
in the cell of the friar, in the den of the weaver;
if we sum up, however inadequately, the state of
things whence it arose, and whence it helped to
deliver us, we may think that the greatest music is
scarcely reverent enough to accompany these poor
blundering rhymes.</p>

<p>The Feast of the Most Holy Sacrament, to whose
liturgy this hymn, "O Res Mirabilis," belongs, was
instituted to commemorate the miracle of Bolsena,
which, coming late as it did, in the country of St.
Francis, and within two years of the birth of Dante,
seems in its significant coincidences, in its startling
symbolism, the fit material summing up of what is
conveniently designated as the Franciscan revival: the
introduction into religious matters of passionate human
emotion. For in the year 1263, at Bolsena in Umbria,
the consecrated wafer dropped blood upon the hands of
an unbelieving priest.</p>

<p>This trickery of a single individual, or more probably
hallucination&mdash;this lie and self-delusion of interested
or foolish bystanders&mdash;just happened to symbolise a
very great reality. For during the earlier Middle Ages,
before the coming of Francis of Assisi, the souls of men,
or, more properly, their hearts, had been sorely troubled
and jeopardised.</p>

<p>The mixture of races and civilisations, southern and
northern and eastern, antique and barbarian, which had
been slowly taking place ever since the fall of the
Roman Empire, had seemed, in its consummation of
the twelfth century, less fertile on the whole than
poisonous. The old tribal system, the old civic system,
triumphant centralising imperialism, had all been broken
up long since; and now feudalism was going to pieces
in its turn, leaving a chaos of filibustering princelets,
among whom loomed the equivocal figures of Proven&ccedil;al
counts, of Angevin and Swabian kings, brutal as men
of the North, and lax as men of the South; moreover,
suspiciously oriental; brilliant and cynical persons,
eventually to be typified in Frederick II., who was
judiciously suspected of being Antichrist in person.
In the midst of this anarchy, over-rapid industrial
development had moreover begotten the tendencies to
promiscuity, to mystical communism, always expressive
of deep popular misery. The Holy Land had become
a freebooter's Eldorado; the defenders of Christ's sepulchre
were turned half-Saracen, infected with unclean
mixtures of creeds. Theology was divided between
neo-Aristotelean logic, abstract and arid, and Alexandrian
esoteric mysticism, quietistic, nay, nihilistic; and
the Church had ceased to answer to any spiritual wants of
the people. Meanwhile, on all sides everywhere, heresies
were teeming, austere and equivocal, pure and unclean
according to individuals, but all of them anarchical,
and therefore destructive at a moment when, above all,
order and discipline were wanted. The belief in the
world's end, in the speedy coming of Antichrist and the
Messiah, was rife among all sects; and learned men, the
disciples of Joachim of Flora, were busy calculating the
very year and month. Lombardy, and most probably
the south of France, Flanders and the Rhine towns, were
full of strange Manichean theosophies, pessimistic dualism
of God and devil, in which God always got the
worst of it, when God did not happen to be the devil
himself. The ravening lions, the clawing, tearing
griffins, the nightmare brood carved on the capitals,
porches, and pulpits of pre-Franciscan churches, are
surely not, as orthodox antiquarians assure us, mere
fanciful symbols of the Church's vigilance and
virtues: they express too well the far-spread occult
Manichean spirit, the belief in a triumphant power
of evil.</p>

<p>Michelet, I think, has remarked that there was a
moment in the early Middle Ages when, in the mixture
of all contrary things, in the very excess of spiritual
movement, there seemed a possibility of dead level, of
stagnation, of the peoples of Europe becoming perhaps
bastard Saracens, as in Merovingian times they had
become bastard Romans; a chance of Byzantinism in the
West. Be this as it may, it seems certain that, towards
the end of the twelfth century, men's souls were shaken,
crumbling, and what was worse, excessively arid. There
was as little certainty of salvation as in the heart of that
Priest saying Mass at Bolsena; but the miracle came to
mankind at large some seventy years before it came to
him. It had begun, no doubt, unnoticed in scores of
obscure heresies, in hundreds of unnoticed individuals;
it became manifest to all the world in the persons of
Dominick, of Elizabeth of Hungary, of King Lewis&mdash;above
all, of Francis of Assisi. As in the hands of the
doubting priest, so in the hands of all suffering mankind,
the mystic wafer broke, proving itself true food for the
soul: the life-blood of hope and love welled forth and
fertilised the world. For the second time, and in far
more humble and efficacious way, Christ had been given
to man.</p>

<p>To absorb the Eternal Love, to feed on the Life of the
World, to make oneself consubstantial therewith, these
passionate joys of poor medi&aelig;val humanity are such as
we should contemplate with sympathy only and respect,
even when the miracle is conceived and felt in the
grossest, least spiritual manner. That act of material
assimilation, that feeding off the very Godhead in most
literal manner, as described in the hymn to the Most
Holy Sacrament, was symbolic of the return from exile
of the long-persecuted instincts of mankind. It meant
that, spiritually or grossly, each according to his nature,
men had cast fear behind them, and&mdash;O res mirabilis!&mdash;grown
proud once more to love.</p>

<p>Of this new wonder&mdash;questionable enough at times,
but, on the whole, marvellously beneficent&mdash;the German
knightly poets, so early in the field, are naturally among
the earliest (for the Proven&ccedil;als belonged to a sceptical,
sensual country) to give us a written record. Nearly
all of the Minnesingers composed what we must call
religious erotics, in no way different, save for names of
Christ and the Virgin, from their most impassioned
secular ones. The Song of Solomon, therefore, is one of
the few pieces of written literature of which we find constant
traces in the works of these very literally illiterate
poets. Yet the quality of their love, if one may say so,
is very different from anything Hebrew, or, for the
matter of that, Greek or Roman; their ardour is not
a transient phenomenon which disturbs them, like that
of the Shulamite, or the lover described by Sappho or
Plato, but a chief business of their life, as in the case of
Dante, of Petrarch, of Francesca and Paolo, or Tristram
and Yseult. Indeed, it is difficult to guess whether this
self-satisfied, self-glorifying quality, which distinguishes
medi&aelig;val passion from the passion (always regarded as
an interlude, harmless or hurtful, in civic concerns) of
unromantic Antiquity&mdash;whether, I say, this peculiarity
of medi&aelig;val love is due to its having served for religious
as well as for secular use, or whether the possibility
of its being brought into connection with the
highest mysteries and aspirations was not itself a result
of the dignity in which mere earthly ardours had come
to be held. Be this as it may, these German devotional
rhapsodies display their essentially un-Hebrew, un-antique
characters only the more by the traces of the
<i>canticus canticorum</i> in them, as in all devout love
lyrics.</p>

<p>Any one curious in such matters may turn to a very
striking poem by Dante's contemporary, Frauenlob, in
Von der Hagen's great collection. Also to a very
strange composition, from the heyday of minne-song,
by Heinrich von Meissen. This is not the furious love
ode, but the ceremonious epithalamium of devotional
poetry. It is the bearing in triumph, among flare of
torches and incense smoke, over flower-strewn streets
and beneath triumphal arches, of the Bride of the Soul,
her enthroning on a stately couch, like some new-wed
Moorish woman, for men to come and covet and admire.
Above all, and giving one a shock of surprise by association
with the man's other work, is a very long and
elaborate poem addressed to Christ or God by no less a
minnesinger than Master Gottfried of Strasburg. In it
the Beloved is compared to all the things desired by eye
or ear or taste or smell: cool water and fruit slaking
feverish thirst, lilies with vertiginous scent, wine firing
the blood, music wakening tears, precious stones of
Augsburger merchants, essences and spices of an Eastern
cargo:&mdash;</p>

<p>And so on for pages; the sort of words which poor
Brangwain may have overheard on the calm sea,
when the terrible knowledge rushed cold to her
heart that Tristram and Yseult had drained the fatal
potion.</p>

<p>All this is foolish and unwholesome enough, just
twice as much so, for its spiritual allegorising, as the
worldly love poetry of these often foolish and unwholesome
German chivalrous poets. But, for our consolation,
in that same huge collection of Von der Hagen's
Minnesingers, stand the following six lines, addressed
to the Saviour, if tradition is correct, by a knightly
monk, Bruder Wernher von der Tegernsee:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou art locked up in my heart; the little key is
lost; thou must remain inside."</p>

<p>This is a way of loving not logically suitable, perhaps,
to a divine essence, but it is the lovingness
which fertilises the soul, and makes flowers bud and
birds sing in the heart of man. Out of it, through
simple creatures like Bruder Wernher, through the
simplicity of scores of obscurer singers and craftsmen
than he, of hundreds of nameless good men and women,
comes one large half of the art of Dante and Giotto,
nay, of Raphael and Shakespeare: the tenderness of the
modern world, unknown to stoical Antiquity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>II</h3>

<p>The early Middle Ages&mdash;the times before Love came,
and with it the gradual dignifying of all realities which
had been left so long to mere gross or cunning or violent
men&mdash;the early Middle Ages have left behind them one
of the most complete and wonderful of human documents,
the letters of Ab&eacute;lard and H&eacute;lo&iuml;se. This is a book which
each of us should read, in order to learn, with terror
and self-gratulation, how the aridity of the world's soul
may neutralise the greatest individual powers for happiness
and good. These letters are as chains which we
should keep in our dwelling-place, to remind us of past
servitude, perhaps to warn us against future.</p>

<p>No other two individuals could have been found to
illustrate, by the force of contrast, the intellectual and
moral aridity of that eleventh century, which yet, in a
degree, was itself a beginning of better things. For
H&eacute;lo&iuml;se and Ab&eacute;lard were not merely among the finest
intellects of the Middle Ages; they were both, in different
ways, to the highest degree passionately innovating
natures. No woman has ever been more rich and bold
and warm of mind and heart than H&eacute;lo&iuml;se; nor has
any woman ever questioned the unquestioned ideas and
institutions of her age, of any age, with such vehemence
and certainty of intuition. She judges questions which
are barely asked and judged of now-a-days, applying
to consecrated sentimentality the long-lost instinctive
human rationalism of the ancient philosophers.
How could St. Luke recommend us to desist from getting
back our stolen property? She feels, however obscurely,
that this is foolish, antisocial, unnatural. Nay, why
should God prefer the penitence of one sinner to the
constant goodness of ninety-nine righteous men? She
is, this learned theologian of the eleventh century, as
passionately human in thought as any Mme. Roland
or Mary Wolstonecraft of a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Ab&eacute;lard, on the other hand, we know to have been
one of the most subtle and solvent thinkers of the Middle
Ages; pursued by the greatest theologians, crushed by
two Councils, and remaining, in the popular fancy,
as a sort of Friar Bacon, a forerunner of the wizard
Faustus; a man whom Bernard of Clairvaux called a
thief of souls, a rapacious wolf, a Herod; a man who reveals
himself a Pagan in his attempts to turn Plato into
a Christian; a man who disputes about Faith in the teeth
of Faith, and criticises the Law in the name of the Law;
a man, most enormous of all, who sees nothing as symbol
or emblem (<i>per speculum in &aelig;nigmate</i>), but dares to
look all things in the face (<i>facie ad faciem omnia intuetur</i>).
<i>Facie ad faciem omnia intuetur</i>, this, which
is the acknowledged method of all modern, as it had
been of all antique, thought, nay, of all modern, all
antique, all healthy spiritual life&mdash;this was the most
damnable habit of Ab&eacute;lard; and, as the letters show, of
H&eacute;lo&iuml;se. What shall we think, in consequence, of the
intellectual and moral sterility of the orthodox world of
the eleventh century, when we find this heretical man,
this rebellious woman, arguing incessantly about unrealities,
crushing out all human feeling, judging all
questions of cause and effect, settling all relations of
life, with reference to a system of intricate symbolical
riddles? These things are exceedingly difficult for a
modern to realise; we feel as though we had penetrated
into some Gulliver's world or kingdom of the Moon; for
theology and its methods have been relegated, these
many hundred years, to a sort of <i>Hortus inclusus</i> where
nothing human grows. These medi&aelig;val men of science
apply their scientific energies to mastering, collecting,
comparing and generalising, not of any single fact of
nature, but of the words of other theologians. The
magnificent sense of intellectual duty, so evident in
Ab&eacute;lard, and in a dozen monastic authors quoted by him,
is applied solely to fantasticating over Scripture and its
expositors, and diverting their every expression from
its literal, honest, sane meaning. And indeed, are some
of the high efforts of medi&aelig;val genius, the calculations
of Joachim and the Eternal Gospel, any better than the
Book of Dreams and the Key to the Lottery? Most
odious, perhaps, in this theology triumphant (sickening
enough, in good sooth, even in the timid official theology
of later days), is the loss of all sense of what's what, of
fitness and decency, which interprets allegorically the
grosser portions of Scripture, and, by a reverse process,
lends to the soul the vilest functions of the body,
and discusses virtue in the terms of fleshliness. No
knowledge can come out of this straw-splitting <i>in vacuo</i>;
and certainly no art out of this indecent pedant's
symbolism: all things are turned to dusty, dirty
lumber.</p>

<p>As with the intellectual, so also, in large degree, with
the moral: a splendid will to do right is applied, in
its turn, to phantoms. Here again the letters of Ab&eacute;lard
and H&eacute;lo&iuml;se are extraordinarily instructive. The
highest virtue, the all-including (how differently Dante
feels, whatever he may say!), is <i>obedience</i>. Thus Ab&eacute;lard,
having quoted from St. Augustine that all which
is done for obedience' sake is well done, proceeds very
logically: "It is more advantageous for us to act rightly
than to do good&hellip;. We should think not so much
of the action itself, as of the manner in which it is
performed."</p>

<p>Do not imagine that this care for the motive and
contempt of the action arises from an estimate of the
importance of a man's sum-total of tendencies, contrasted
with his single, perhaps unintentional, acts;
still less that the advantage thus referred to has anything
to do with other men's happiness. The advantage
is merely to the individual soul, or in a cruder,
truer view, to the individual combustible body to which
that soul shall be eternally reunited hereafter. And
the spirit which makes virtue alone virtuous is the
spirit of obedience: obedience theoretically to a god,
but practically to a father of the Church, a Council, an
abbot or abbess. In this manner right-doing is emptied
of all rational significance, becomes dependent upon
what itself, having no human, practical reason, is mere
arbitrary command. Chastity, for instance, which is,
together with mansuetude, the especial Christian
virtue, becomes in this fashion that mere guarding of
virginity which, for some occult reason, is highly prized
in Heaven; as to clean living being indispensable for
bearable human relations, which even the unascetic
ancients recognised so clearly, there is never an inkling
of that. Whence, indeed, such persons as do not <i>go in
for</i> professionally pleasing the divinity, who are neither
priests, monks, nor nuns, need not stickle about it; and
the secular literature of the Middle Ages, with its
Launcelots, Tristrams, Flamencas, and all its German
and Proven&ccedil;al lyrists, becomes the glorification of illicit
love. Indeed, in the letters before us, Ab&eacute;lard regrets
his former misconduct only with reference to religious
standards: as a layman he was perfectly free to seduce
H&eacute;lo&iuml;se; the scandal, the horrible sin, was not the
seduction, but the profanation by married love of the
dress of a nun, the sanctuary of the virgin. So it is
with the renunciation of all the world's pleasures and
interests. The ascetic sacrifice of inclination, which
the stoics had conceived as resistance to the tyrant
without and the tyrant within, as a method for serene
and independent life and death, this ascetic renunciation
becomes, in this arid theological world, the mere
giving up to please a jealous God of all that is not He.
Ab&eacute;lard's regulations for the nuns, which he gives as
rules of perfection (save in the matter of that necessary
half sin, marriage) to devout lay folk, come after all to
this: give human nature enough to keep it going, so
that it may be able to sacrifice everything else to the
jealousy of the Godhead. Eating, clothing oneself,
washing (though, by the way, there is no mention of
this save for the sick), nay, speaking and thinking, are
merely instrumental to the contemplation of God; any
more than suffices for this is sinful. On this point
Ab&eacute;lard quotes, with stolidest approval, one of the
most heart-rending of anecdotes. A certain monk
being asked why he had fled humankind, answered, on
account of his great love for it, and the impossibility
of loving God and it at the same time.</p>

<p>Think upon that. Think on the wasted treasure of
loving-kindness of which that monk and the thousands
he represents cheated his fellow-men. O love of human
creatures, of man for woman, parents and children,
of brethren, love of friends; fuel and food, which
keeps the soul alive, balm curing its wounds, or, if
they be incurable, helps the poor dying thing to die at
last in peace&mdash;this was those early saints' notion of
thee!</p>

<p>To refuse thus to love is to refuse not merely the
highest usefulness, but to refuse also the best kind of
justice. Here again, nay, here more than ever, we may
learn from those wonderful letters. They constitute,
indeed, a document of the human soul to which, in my
recollection, one other only, Benjamin Constant's <i>Adolphe</i>,
can be compared. But in these letters,&mdash;hers of grief,
humiliation, hopelessness, making her malign her noble
self; and his, bitter, self-righteous, crammed with
theological moralisings&mdash;we see not merely the dual
drama of two ill-assorted creatures, but the much
more terrible tragedy, superadded by the presence,
looming, impassive, as of Cypris in Euripides' Hippolytus,
of a third all-powerful and superhuman entity:
the spirit of monasticism. The unequal misery, the
martyrdom of H&eacute;lo&iuml;se arises herefrom, that she rebels
against this <i>Deus ex machina</i>; that this nun of the
eleventh century is a strong warm-hearted modern
woman, fit for Browning. While Ab&eacute;lard is her
whole life, the intimate companion of her highest
thoughts, she is only a toy to him, and a toy which
his theologian's pride, his monkish self-debasement,
makes him afraid and ashamed of. Ab&eacute;lard has
been for her, and ever remains, something like
Brahma to Goethe's Bayadere; her love, her love
above all for his intrepid intellect, has raised him
to a sacredness so great, that his whim, his fame, his
peace, his very petulance can be refused nothing; and
that, on the other hand, any concession taken from
him seems positive sacrilege. Hence her refusal of marriage,
her answer, "that she would be prouder as his
mistress&mdash;the Latin word is harlot&mdash;than as the wife
of C&aelig;sar." Fifty years later, in the kind, passionate,
poetical days of St. Francis, H&eacute;lo&iuml;se might have given
this loving fervour to Christ, and been a happy, if a
deluded, woman; but in those frigid monkish days, there
was no one for her to love, save this frigid monkish
Ab&eacute;lard. As it is, therefore, she loves Christ and God
in obedience to Ab&eacute;lard; she passionately cons the
fathers, the Scriptures, merely because, so to speak, the
hand of Ab&eacute;lard has lain on the page, the eyes of Ab&eacute;lard
have followed the characters; and finally, after all her
vain entreaties for (she scarce knows what!) love, sympathy,
one personal word, she feeds her starving heart
on the only answer to her supplications&mdash;the dialectic
exercises, metaphysical treatises, and theological sermons
(containing even the forms applicable only to a
congregation) which he doles out to her. Thankful for
anything which comes <i>from</i> him, however little it comes
<i>to</i> her.</p>

<p>How different with Ab&eacute;lard! Despite occasional
atrocious misery and unparalleled temporal misfortunes
(which on the whole act upon him as tonics), this great
metaphysician is well suited to his times, and spiritually
thrives in their exhausted, chill atmosphere. The public
rumour (which H&eacute;lo&iuml;se hurls at him in a fit of broken-hearted
rage), that his passion for her had been but a
passing folly of the flesh, he never denies, but, on the
contrary, reiterates perpetually for her spiritual improvement;
let her understand clearly from what inexpressible
degradation God in His mercy has saved them,
at least saved him; let her realise that he wanted only
carnal indulgence, and would have got it, if need be,
through threats and blows. He recognises, in his past,
only a feeling which, now it is over, fills his ascetic mind
with nothing but disgust and burning shame, and hence
he tries, by degrading it still more, by cynically raking
up all imaginable filth, to separate that past from his
present. So far, were only he himself concerned, one
would sympathise, though contemptuously, with this
agonised reaction of a proud, perhaps a vain, <i>man</i> of
mere intellect. But the atrocious thing is, that he treats
her as a loathsome relic of this past dishonour; and
answers her prayer (after twelve years' silence!) for a
word of loving-kindness by elaborate denunciations of
their former love, and reiterated jubilations that <i>he</i>, at
least, has long been purged thereof; not unmixed with
sharp admonishment that she had better not try to
infect his soul afresh, but set about, if needful, cleansing
her own. Now it so happens that what he would cure
her of is incurable, being, in fact, eternal, divine&mdash;simple
human love. So, to his pious and cynical admonitions
she answers with strange inconsistency. Long brooding
over his taunts will sometimes make her, to whom
he is always the divinity, actually believe, despite her
reiteration, that she had sinned out of obedience to him,
that she really is a polluted creature, guilty of the
unutterable crime of contaminating a man of God, nay,
a god himself. And then, unable to silence affection,
she cries out in agony at the perversity of her nature,
incapable even of hating sincerely its sinfulness; for
would she not do it again, is she not the same H&eacute;lo&iuml;se who
would have left the very altar, the very communion with
Christ, at Ab&eacute;lard's word? At other times she is pious,
resigned, almost serene; for is that not Ab&eacute;lard's wish?
a careful mother to her nuns. But when, encouraged
by her docility and blind to her undying love, Ab&eacute;lard
believes that he has succeeded in quieting her down,
and rewards her piety by some rhetorical phrase of
Monkish eulogy, she suddenly turns round, a terrible
tragic figure. She repudiates the supposed purity and
piety, blazons out her wickedness and hypocrisy, and
cries out, partly with the horror of the sacrilegious nun,
mainly with the pride of the faithful wife, that it is
not God she loves but Ab&eacute;lard.</p>

<p>After the most violent of these outbreaks there
is a dead silence. One guesses that some terrible
message has come, warning her that unless she promised
that she would never write to Ab&eacute;lard save
as the Abbess of the Paraclete to the monk of Cluny,
not a word from him shall ever come; and that, in
order to keep this last miserable comfort, she has
bitten out that truth-speaking tongue of hers. For
after this there are only questions on theological
points and on the regulation of nunneries; and Ab&eacute;lard
becomes as liberal of words as he used to be
chary, as full of encouragement as he once was of
insult, now that he feels comfortably certain that
H&eacute;lo&iuml;se has changed from a mistress to a penitent,
and that in her also there is an end at last of all
that sinful folly of love. And thus, upon H&eacute;lo&iuml;se
pacified, numbed, dead of soul, among her praying
and scrubbing and cooking and linen-mending nuns;
and Ab&eacute;lard reassured, serene, spiritually proud once
more among the raging controversies, the ecclesiastical
persecutions in which his soul prospered, the volume
closes; the curtain falls upon one of the most terrible
tragedies of the heart, as poignant after seven hundred
years as in those early Middle Ages, before St. Francis
claimed sun and swallows as brethren, and the baby
Christ was given to hold to St. Anthony of Padua.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>III</h3>

<p>The humanising movement, due no doubt to greater
liberty and prosperity, to the growing importance
of honest burgher life, which the Church authorised
in the person of Francis of Assisi, doubtless after
persecuting it in the persons of dozens of obscure
heresiarchs&mdash;this great revival of religious faith
was essentially the triumph of profane feeling in the
garb of religious: the sanctification, however much
disguised, of all forms of human love. One is fully
aware of the moral dangers attendant upon every
such equivocation; and the great saints (like their last
modern representatives, the fervent, shrewd, and kindly
leaders of certain Protestant revivals) were probably,
for all their personal extravagances, most fully prepared
for every sort of unwholesome folly among their
disciples. The whole of a certain kind of devotional
literature, manuals of piety, Church hymns, lives and
correspondence of saintly persons, is unanimous in
testifying to the hysterical self-consciousness, intellectual
enervation, emotional going-to-bits, and moral
impotence produced by such vicarious and barren expenditure
of feeling. Yet it seems to me certain that
this enthroning of human love in matters spiritual was
an enormous, indispensable improvement, which, whatever
detriment it may have brought in individual and,
so to say, professionally religious cases, nay, perhaps to
all religion as a whole, became perfectly wholesome and
incalculably beneficent in the enormous mass of right-minded
laity.</p>

<p>For human emotion, although so often run to waste,
had been at least elicited, and, once elicited, could find,
in nine cases out of ten, its true and beneficent channel;
whereas, in the earlier medi&aelig;val days, the effort to
crush out all human feeling (as with that holy man
quoted by Ab&eacute;lard), to break all human solidarity, had
not merely left the world in the hands of unscrupulous
and brutal persons, but had imprisoned all finer
souls in solitary and selfish thoughts of their individual
salvation. Things were now different. The story
of Lucchesio of Poggibonsi, recovered from oblivion
by M. Paul Sabatier, is the most lovely expression
of Franciscan tenderness and reverence towards the
affections of the laymen, and ought to be remembered
in company with the legend of the wood-pigeons,
whom St. Francis established in his cabin and blessed
in their courtship and nesting. This Lucchesio had
exercised a profession which has ever savoured of
damnation to the minds of the poor and their lovers,
that of corn merchant or speculator in grain; but
touched by Franciscan preaching, he had kept only one
small garden, which, together with his wife, he cultivated
half for the benefit of the poor. One day the
wife, known in the legend only as Bona Donna, sickened
and knew she must die, and the sacrament was brought
to her accordingly. But Lucchesio never thought that
it could be God's will that he should remain on earth
after his wife had been taken from him. So he got
himself shriven, received the last sacraments with her,
held her hands while she died; and when she was dead,
stretched himself out, made the sign of the cross, called
on Jesus, Mary, and St. Francis, and peacefully died in
his turn: God could not have wished him to live on
without her. The passionate Franciscan sympathy
with human love makes light of all the accepted notions
of bereavement being acceptable as a divine dispensation.
Lucchesio of Poggibonsi was, we are told, a
member of the Third Order of Franciscans, and his
legend may help us to appreciate the value of such
institutions, which gave heaven to the laity, to the
married burgher, the artisan, the peasant; which fertilised
the religious ideal with the simplest and sweetest
instincts of mankind. But, Third Order apart, the
mission of the regular Franciscans and Dominicans
is wholly different from that of the earlier orders of
monasticism proper. The earlier monks, however useful
and venerable as tillers of the soil and students of
all sciences, were, nevertheless, only agglomerated hermits,
retired from the world for the safety each of his
own soul; whereas the preaching, wandering friars are
men who mix with the world for the sake of souls of
others. Thus, throughout the evolution of religious
communities, down to the Jesuits and Oratorians,
to the great nursing brother-and sisterhoods of the
seventeenth century, we can watch the substitution
of care for lay souls in the place of more saintly
ones&mdash;a gradual secularisation in unsuspected harmony
with the heretical and philosophical movements which
tend more and more to make religion an essential
function of life, instead of an activity with which life
is for ever at variance.</p>

<p>In accordance with this evolution is the great enthroning
of love in the thirteenth century: it means
the replacing of the terror of a divinity, who was little
better than a metaphysical Moloch (sometimes, and
oftener than we think, a metaphysical Ormuzd and
Ahriman of Manichean character), by the idolatry of
an all-gracious Virgin, of an all-compassionate and all-sympathising
Christ.</p>

<p>It was an effort at self-righting of the unhappy world,
this love-fever which followed on the many centuries of
monastic self-mutilation; for, in sickness of the spirit,
the hot stage, for all its delirium, means a possibility
of life. Moreover, it gave to mankind a plenitude of
happiness such as is necessary, whether reasonable or
unreasonable, for mankind to continue living at all;
art, poetry, freedom, all the things which form the <i>Viaticum</i>
on mankind's journey through the dreary ages,
requiring for their production, it would seem, an extra
dose of faith, of hope, and happiness. Indeed, the
Franciscan movement is important not so much for its
humanitarian quality as for its optimism.</p>

<p>Many other religious movements have asserted, with
equal and greater efficacy, the need for charity and
loving-kindness; but none, as it seems to me, has conceived
like it that charity and loving-kindness are not mitigations
of misery, but aids to joy. The universal brotherhood,
preached by Francis of Assisi, is a brotherhood
not of suffering, but of happiness, nay, of life and of
happiness.</p>

<p>The sun, in the wonderful song which he made&mdash;characteristically&mdash;during
his sickness, is the brother of
man because of his radiance and splendour; water and
fire are his brethren on account of their virtues of purity
and humbleness, of jocund and beautiful strength;<a href="#fn1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a><a name="fn1r" id="fn1r"></a> and
if we find, throughout his legends, the Saint perpetually
accompanied by birds&mdash;the swallows he begged to let
him speak, the falcon who called him in the morning,
the turtle-doves whose pairing he blessed, and all the
feathered flock whom Benozzo represents him preaching
to in the lovely fresco at Montefalco&mdash;if, as I say, there
is throughout his life and thoughts a sort of perpetual
whir and twitter of birds, it is, one feels sure, because
the creatures of the air, free to come and go, to sit on
beautiful trees, to drink of clear streams, to play in the
sunshine and storm, able above all to be like himself,
poets singing to God, are the symbols, in the eyes of
Francis, of the greatest conceivable felicity.<a href="#fn2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a><a name="fn2r" id="fn2r"></a></p>

<p>Indeed, we can judge of what the Franciscan movement
was to the world by what its gospel, the divine
<i>Fioretti</i>, are even to ourselves. This humble collection
of stories and sayings, sometimes foolish, always childlike,
becomes, to those who have read it with more than
the eyes of the body, a beloved and necessary companion,
like the solemn serene books of antique wisdom, the
passionate bitter Book of Job, almost, in a way, like the
Gospels of Christ. But not for the same reason: the
book of Francis teaches neither heroism nor resignation,
nor divine justice and mercy; it teaches love and joyfulness.
It keeps us for ever in the company of creatures
who are happy because they are loving: whether the
creatures be poor, crazy Brother Juniper (the comic
person of the cycle) eating his posset in brotherly
happiness with the superior he had angered; or Brother
Masseo, unable from sheer joy in Christ to articulate
anything save "U-u-u," "like a pigeon;" or King Lewis
of France falling into the arms of Brother Egidio; or
whether they be the Archangel Michael in friendly converse
with Brother Peter, or the Madonna handing the
divine child for Brother Conrad to kiss, or even the
Wolf of Gubbio, converted, and faithfully fulfilling his
bargain. There are sentences in the <i>Fioretti</i> such as
exist perhaps in no other book in the world, and which
teach something as important, after all, as wisdom
even and perfect charity&mdash;"And there answered Brother
Egidio: Beloved brethren, know that as soon as he and
I embraced one another, the light of wisdom revealed
and manifested to me his heart, and to him mine; and
thus by divine operation, seeing one into the other's
heart, that which I would have said to him and he to
me, each understood much better than had we spoken
with our tongue, and with greater joyfulness&hellip;."
Again, Jesus appeared to Brother Ruffino and said,
"Well didst thou do, my son, inasmuch as thou believedst
the words of St. Francis; for he who saddened
thee was the demon, whereas I am Christ thy teacher;
and for token thereof I will give thee this sign: As
long as thou live, thou shalt never feel affliction of any
sort nor sadness of heart."</p>

<p>St. Francis, we are told, being infirm of body, was
comforted through God's goodness by a vision of the
joy of the blessed. "Suddenly there appeared to him
an angel in a great radiance, which angel held a viol in
his left hand and a bow in his right. And while St.
Francis remained in stupefaction at the sight, this angel
drew the bow once <i>upwards</i> across the viol, and instantly
there issued such sweetness of melody as melted the
soul of St. Francis, and suspended it from all bodily
sense. And, as he afterwards told his companions, he
was of opinion that if that angel had drawn the bow
<i>downwards</i> (instead of upwards) across the viol, his soul
would have departed from his body for the very excess
of delight."</p>

<p>It was not so much to save the souls of men from
hell, about which, indeed, there is comparatively
little talk in the <i>Fioretti</i>, but to draw them also into
the mystic circle where such angelic music was heard,
that Francis of Assisi preached throughout Umbria,
and even as far as the Soldan's country; and, if we
interpret it rightly, the strings of that heavenly
viol were the works of creation and the souls of
all creatures, and the bow, whose upward movement
ravished, and whose downward movement would have
almost annihilated with its sweetness, that bow
drawn across the vibrating world was no other
than love.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Justice preached by Hebrew prophets, charity and
purity taught by Jesus of Nazareth, fortitude recommended
by Epictetus and Aurelius, none of these
great messages to men necessarily produce that special
response which we call Art. But the message of loving
joyfulness, of happiness in the world and the world's
creatures, whether men or birds, or sun or moon,&mdash;this
message, which was that of St. Francis, sets the soul
singing; and just such singing of the soul makes art.
Hence, even as the Apennine blazed with supernatural
light, and its forests and rocks became visible to the most
distant wayfarers, when the Eternal Love smote with its
beams the praying saint on La Vernia; so also the
souls of those men of the Middle Ages were made luminous
and visible by the miracle of poetry and painting,
and we can see them still, distinct even at this distance.</p>

<p>One of the earliest of the souls so revealed is
that of the Blessed Jacopone of Todi. Jacopo dei
Benedetti, a fellow-countryman of St. Francis, must
have been born in the middle of the thirteenth
century, and is said to have died in 1316, when
Dante, presumably, was writing his "Purgatory" and
"Paradise;" to him is ascribed the authorship of
the hymn "Stabat Mater," remembered, and to be
remembered (owing to the embalming power of music)
far beyond his vernacular poems. Tradition has it that
he turned to the religious life in consequence of the
sudden death of his beloved, and the discovery that she
had worn a hair-shirt next her delicate body. Be this
as it may, many allusions in his poems suggest that he
had lived the wild life of the barbarous Umbrian cities,
being a highwayman perhaps, forfeiting his life, and
also having to fly the country before the fury of some
family vendetta. On the other hand, it is plain
at every line that he was a frantic ascetic, taking a
savage pleasure in vilifying all mundane things, and
passionately disdainful of study, of philosophical and
theological subtleties. No poet, therefore, of the troubadour
sort, or of the idealising learned refinement of
Guinicelli or Cavalcanti. Nor was his life one of
apostolic sweetness. Having taken part in the furious
Franciscan schism, and pursued with invectives Boniface
VIII., he was cast by that Pope into a dungeon
at Palestrina. "My dwelling," he writes, "is subterranean,
and a cesspool opens on to it; hence a smell
not of musk. No one can speak to me; the man who
waits on me may, but he is obliged to make confession
of my sayings. I wear jesses like a falcon, and ring
whenever I move: he who comes near my room may
hear a queer kind of dance. When I have laid myself
down, I am tripped up by the irons, and wound round
in a big chain (<i>negli ferri inzampagliato, inguainato
in catenone</i>). I have a little basket hung up so that
the mice may not injure it; it can hold five loaves&hellip;.
While I eat them little by little, I suffer great cold."</p>

<p>Moreover, Pope Boniface refuses him absolution, and
Jacopone's invectives are alternated with heart-rending
petitions that this mercy at least be shown him; as to
his other woes, he will endure them till his death. In
this frightful place Jacopone had visions, which the
Church, giving him therefore the title of Blessed, ratifies
as genuine. One might expect nightmares, such as troubled
the early saints in the wilderness, or John Bunyan
in gaol; but that was not the spirit of the medi&aelig;val
revival: terror had been cast out by love. More than
a quarter of Jacopone's huge volume consists in what
is merely love poetry: he is languishing, consumed by
love; when the beloved departs, he sighs and weeps,
and shrieks, and <i>dies alive</i>. Will the beloved have
no mercy? "Jesu, donami la morte, o di te fammi
assaggiare." Then the joys of love, depicted with
equal liveliness, amplifications as usual of the erotic
hyperboles of the Shulamite and her lover; the phenomenon,
to whose uncouth strangeness devotional poetry
accustoms us even now-a-days, which we remarked in
Gottfried von Strasburg and Frauenlob, and on which
it is needless further to insist.</p>

<p>But there is here in Jacopone something which we
missed in Gottfried and Frauenlob, of which there is
no trace in the Song of Solomon, but which, suggested
in the lovely six lines of Bruder Wernher, makes the
emotionalism of the Italian Middle Ages wholesome
and fruitful. A child-like boy and girlish light-heartedness
that makes love a matter not merely of
sighing and dying, but of singing and dancing; and,
proceeding thence, a fervour of loving delightedness
which is no longer of the man towards the woman, but
of the man and the woman towards the baby. The
pious monk, in his ecstasies over Jesus, intones a song
which might be that of those passionate <i>farandoles</i>
of angels who dance and carol in Botticelli's most
rapturous pictures:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
 <table class="sm" style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="text">
<tr><td align="left">"Amore, amor, dove m'hai tu menato?</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;Amore, amor, fuor di me m'hai trattato.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;Ciascun amante, amator del Signore,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;Venga alla danza cantando d'amore."</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Can we not see them, the souls of such fervent lovers,
swaying and eddying, with joined hands and flapping
wings, flowers dropping from their hair, above the
thatched roof of the stable at Bethlehem?</p>

<p>The stable at Bethlehem! It is perpetually returning
to Jacopone's thoughts. The cell, the dreadful
underground prison at Palestrina, is broken through,
irradiated by visions which seem paintings by Lippo
or Ghirlandaio, nay, by Correggio and Titian themselves,
"the tender baby body (<i>il tenerin corpo</i>) of the blood
of Mary has been given in charge to a pure company;
St. Joseph and the Virgin contemplate the
little creature (<i>il piccolino</i>) with stupefaction. <i>O gran
piccolino Jesu nostro diletto</i>, he who had seen Thee between
the ox and the little ass, breathing upon thy
holy breast, would not have guessed thou were begotten
of the Trinity!" But besides the ox and the ass there
are the angels. "In the worthy stable of the sweet
baby the angels are singing round the little one; they
sing and cry out, the beloved angels, quite reverent,
timid and shy (<i>tutti riverenti, timidi e subbietti</i>, this
beautiful expression is almost impossible save in
Italian), round the little baby Prince of the Elect who
lies naked among the prickly hay. He lies naked and
without covering; the angels shout in the heights. And
they wonder greatly that to such lowliness the Divine
Verb should have stooped. The Divine Verb, which
is highest knowledge, this day seems as if He knew
nothing of anything (<i>il verbo divino che &egrave; sommo sapiente,
in questo di par che non sappia niente!</i>). Look at him on
the hay, crying and kicking (<i>che gambetta piangente</i>), as
if He were not at all a divine man&hellip;." Meanwhile,
other angels, as in Benozzo's frescoes, are busy "picking
rarest flowers in the garden." In the garden! Why
He Himself is a fragrant garden; Jesus is a garden of
many sweet odours; and "what they are those can tell
who are the lovers of this sweet little brother of ours."</p>

<p><i>Di Questo nostro dolce fratellino</i>: it is such expressions
as these, Bambolino, Piccolino, Garzolino, "el magno
Jesulino," these caressing, ever-varied diminutives,
which make us understand the monk's passionate
pleasure in the child; and which, by the emotion they
testify to and re-awaken, draw more into relief, make
visible and tangible the little kicking limbs on the
straw, the dimpled baby's body.</p>

<p>And then there are the choruses of angels. "O new
song," writes Jacopone, "which has killed the weeping
of sick mankind! Its melody, methinks, begins upon
the high <i>Fa</i>, descending gently on the <i>Fa</i> below, which
the <i>Verb</i> sounds. The singers, jubilating, forming the
choir, are the holy angels, singing songs in that
hostelry, before the little babe, who is the Incarnate
Word. On lamb's parchment, behold! the divine note
is written, and God is the scribe, Who has opened His
hand, and has taught the song."</p>

<p>Have we not here, in this odd earliest allegory of
music and theology, this earliest precursor of the organ-playing
of Abt Vogler, one of those choirs, clusters of
singing childish heads&mdash;clusters, you might almost say,
of sweet treble notes, tied like nosegays by the score
held scrollwise across them, which are among the
sweetest inventions of Italian art, from Luca della
Robbia to Raphael, "cantatori, guibilatori, che tengon
il coro?"</p>

<p>And this is the place for a remark which, in the
present uncertainty of all &aelig;sthetic psychology, I put
forward as a mere suggestion, but a suggestion less
wide of the truth than certain theories now almost
unquestioned: the theories which arbitrarily assume
that art is the immediate and exact expression of contemporary
spiritual aspirations and troubles. That
such may be the case with literature, particularly the
more ephemeral kinds thereof, is very likely, since
literature, save in the great complex structures of epos,
tragedy, choral lyric, is but the development of daily
speech, and possibly as upstart, as purely passing, as
daily speech itself; moreover, in its less artistic forms,
requiring little science or apprenticeship.</p>

<p>But art is a thing of older ancestry; you cannot,
however bursting with emotion, embody your feelings
in forms like those of Phidias, of Michelangelo, of Bach,
or Mozart, unless such forms have come ready to hand
through the long, steady working of generations of men:
Phidias and Bach in person, cut off from their precursors,
would not, for all their genius, get as far as a
schoolboy's caricature, or a savage's performance on a
marrow-bone. And these slowly elaborated forms,
representing the steady impact of so many powerful
minds, representing, moreover, the organic necessity by
which, a given movement once started, that movement
is bound to proceed in a given direction, these forms
cannot be altered, save infinitesimally, to represent the
particular state of the human soul at a given moment.
You might as well suppose that the human shape
itself, evolved through these millions of years, could
suddenly be accommodated to perfect representation
of the momentary condition of certain human beings;
even the Tricoteuses of the guillotine had the heads
and arms of ordinary women, not the beaks and claws
of harpies. Hence such expressiveness must be limited
to microscopic alterations; and, indeed, one marvels at
the modest demands of the art critics, who are satisfied
with the pucker of a frontal muscle of a Praxitelean
head as testimony to the terrible deep disorder in the
post-Periclean Greek spirit, and who can still find in
the later paintings of Titian, when all that makes Titian
visible and admirable is deducted, a something, just
a little <i>je ne sais quoi</i>, which proves these later Titians
to have originated in the Catholic reaction. If the
theory of art as the outcome of momentary conditions
be limited to such particularities, I am quite willing to
accept it; only, such particularities do not constitute the
large, important and really valuable characteristics of
art, and it matters very little by what they are produced.</p>

<p>How then do matters stand between art and civilisation?
Here follows my hypothesis. There is in the
history of every art (and for brevity's sake, I include
in this term every distinct category, say, renaissance
sculpture as distinguished from antique, of the same
art) a moment when, for one reason or other, that art
begins to come to the fore, to bestir itself. The circumstances
of the nation and time make this art
materially advantageous or spiritually attractive; the
opening up of quarries, the discovery of metallic alloys,
the necessity of roofing larger spaces, the demand for
a sedentary amusement, for music to dance to in new
social gatherings&mdash;any such humble reason, besides
many others, can cause one art to issue more particularly
out of the limbo of the undeveloped, or out of the
lumber-room of the unused.</p>

<p>It is during this historic moment&mdash;a moment which
may last years or scores of years&mdash;that, as it seems
to me, an art can really be deeply affected by its surrounding
civilisation. For is it not called forth by that
civilisation's requirements, material or spiritual; and
is it not, by the very fact of being thus new, or at
all events nascent, devoid of all conditioning factors,
save those which the civilisation and its requirements
impose from without? An art, like everything vital,
takes shape not merely by pressure from without, but
much more by the necessities inherent in its own constitution,
the almost mechanical necessities by which all
variable things <i>can</i> vary only in certain fashions. All
the natural selection, all the outer pressure in the world,
cannot make a stone become larger by cutting, cannot
make colour less complex by mixing, cannot make the
ear perceive a dissonance more easily than a consonance,
cannot make the human mind turn back from problems
once opened up, or revert instantaneously to effects it
is sick of; and a number of such immutable necessities
constitute what we call the organism of an art, which
can therefore respond only in one way and not another
to the influences of surrounding civilisation. Given the
sculpture of the &AElig;gina period, it is impossible we should
not arrive at the sculpture of the time of Alexander: the
very constitution of clay and bronze, of marble, chisel
and mallet, let alone that of the human mind, makes
it inevitable; and you would have it inevitably if you
could invert history, and put Ch&aelig;ronea in the place of
Salamis. But there is no reason why you should eventually
get Lysippian and Praxitelean sculpture instead
of Egyptian or Assyrian, say, in the time of Homer,
whenever that may have been. For the causes which
forced Greek sculpture along the line leading to Praxiteles
and Lysippus were not yet at work; and had other
forces, say, a preference for stone work instead of clay
and bronze work, a habit of Persian or Gaulish garments,
of Lydian effeminate life instead of Dorian
athleticism, supervened, had satraps ordered rock-reliefs
of battles instead of burghers ordering brazen images of
boxers and runners, Praxiteles and Lysippus might have
remained <i>in mente Dei</i>, if, indeed, even there. Similarly,
once given your Pisan sculptors, Giotto, nay, your imaginary
Cimabue, you inevitably get your Donatello,
Masaccio, Ghirlandajo, and eventually your Leonardo,
Michelangelo, and Titian; for the problems of form and
of sentiment, the questions of perspective, anatomy,
dramatic expression, lyric suggestion, architectural decoration,
were established, in however rudimentary a
manner, as soon as painting was ordered to leave off
doing idle, emotionless Christs, rows of gala saints and
symbols of metaphysic theology, and told to set about
showing the episodes of Scripture, the things Christ and
the Apostles did, and the places where they did them,
and the feelings they felt about it all; told to make
visible to the eye the gallant archangels, the lovable
Madonnas, the dear little baby Saviours, the angels with
their flowers and songs, all the human hope and pity
and passion and tenderness which possessed the world
in the days of St. Francis.</p>

<p>What pictures should we have seen if Christianity
(which was impossible) had continued in the habits of
thought and feeling of the earlier Middle Ages? Byzantine
<i>icones</i> become frightfuler and frightfuler, their
theological piety perhaps sometimes relieved by odd
wicked Manichean symbolism; all talent and sentiment
abandoning painting, perhaps to the advantage of music,
whose solemn period of recondite contrapuntal complexity&mdash;something
corresponding to the ingenuities and
mysticism of theology&mdash;might have come two centuries
earlier, and delighted the world instead of being unnoticed
by it. Be this as it may, there is no need
for wondering, as people occasionally wonder, how
the solemn terror, the sweetness, pathos, or serenity
of men like Signorelli, Botticelli, or Perugino, nay
Michelangelo, Raphael, or Giorgione, could have originated
among Malatestas, Borgias, Poggios, or Aretines.
It did not. And, therefore, since literature always precedes
its more heavily cumbered fellow-servant art, we
must look for the literary counterpart of the painters
of the Renaissance among the writers who preceded
them by many generations, men more obviously in touch
with the great medi&aelig;val revival: Dante, Boccaccio, the
compilers of the "Fioretti di San Francesco," and, as
we have just seen, Fra Jacopone da Todi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>What art would there have been without that Franciscan
revival, or rather what emotional synthesis of
life would art have had to record? This speculation
has been dismissed as futile, because it is impossible to
conceive that mankind could have gone on without some
such enthusiastic return of faith in the goodness of
things. But another question remains to be answered,
remains to be asked; and that is, what was the spiritual
meaning of the art which immediately preceded the
Franciscan revival? what was the emotional synthesis
of life given by those who had come too early to partake
in the new religion of love?</p>

<p>The question seems scarcely to have occurred to any
one, perhaps because the Church found it expedient
to obliterate, to the best of her power, all records of her
terrible medi&aelig;val vicissitudes, and to misinterpret, for
the benefit of purblind antiquarians, the architectural
symbolism of the earlier Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Since, in the deciphering of such expressions of mankind's
moods and intuitions, scientific investigation is
scarcely more important than the moods and intuitions
of the looker-on, it seems quite fitting that I should
begin these suggestions about pre-Franciscan Italian
art by saying that some years ago there met by accident
in my mind a certain impression of Lombard twelfth-century
art, and a certain anecdote of Lombard twelfth-century
history.</p>

<p>It was at Lucca, a place most singularly rich in
round-arched buildings, that I was, so to speak,
overwhelmed by the fact that the Italian churches
of immediately pre-Franciscan days possess by way
of architectural ornamentation nothing but images of
deformity and emblems of wickedness. This fact, apart
from its historical bearing, may serve also to illustrate a
theory I have already put forth, to wit, that the only art
which is necessarily expressive of contemporary thought
and feeling is such as embodies very little skill, and as
expresses but very few organic necessities of form, both
of which can result only from the activity and the
influence of generations of craftsmen; since in these
Lucchese churches the architectural forms proclaim one
thing and the sculptural details another. The first
speak only of logic and serenity; the second only of the
most abominable nightmare. The truth is, that these
churches of Lucca, and their more complex and perfect
prototypes, like Sant' Ambrogio of Milan, and San
Miniato of Florence, are not the real outcome of the
century which built them. It is quite natural that, with
their stately proportions, their harmonious restrained
vaultings, their easy, efficient colonnades, their ample
and equable illumination, above all their obvious pleasure
in constructive logic, these churches should affect us as
being <i>classic</i> as opposed to romantic, and even in a very
large measure actually antique; for they have come,
through generations as long-lived and as scanty as those
of the patriarchs, straight from the classic, the antique;
grandchildren of the courts of law and temples of
Pagan Rome, children of the Byzantine basilicas of
early Christian days; strange survivals from distant
antiquity, testifying to the lack of artistic initiative in
the barbarous centuries between Constantine to
Barbarossa. No period in the world's history could have
produced anything so organic without the work of
previous periods; and when the Middle Ages did in
their turn produce an architecture original to themselves,
it was by altering these still classic forms into
something absolutely different: that thirteenth-century
Gothic which answers to the material and necessities
of the democratic and romantic times heralded by St.
Francis. The twelfth century, therefore, could not
express itself in the architectural forms and harmonies
of those Lucchese churches; but it could express itself
in their rude and thoroughly original sculpture. Hence,
while there is in them no indication of the symbolism
of the coming ogival Gothic, there is no trace either of
the symbolism belonging to Byzantine buildings. None
of the Gothic imagery testifying faith and joy in God
and His creatures; no effigies of saints; at most only of
the particular building's patron; no Madonnas, infant
Christs, burning cherubim, singing and playing angels,
armed romantic St. Michael or St. George; none of
those goodly rows of kings and queens guarding the
portals, or of those charming youthful heads marking
the spring of the pointed arch, the curve of the spandril.
Nor, on the other hand, any remnant of Byzantine
devices of the date-loaded palms, the peacocks and
doves, the bunches of grapes, the serene, almost Pagan
imagery which graces the churches of the C&aelig;lian and
Aventine, the basilicas of Ravenna, and which would
seem the necessary accompaniment of this stately
Neo-Byzantine architecture. The churches of Lucca,
like their contemporaries and immediate predecessors
throughout Tuscany and North Italy, are ornamented
only with symbols of terror.<a href="#fn3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a><a name="fn3r" id="fn3r"></a></p>

<p>The minds of the sculptors seem haunted by the
terror of wicked wild beasts, irresistible and mysterious,
as in the night fears of children. The chief ornament
of St. Michael of Lucca is a curious band of black and
white inlaid work, of which Mr. Ruskin has said, with
the optimism of an orthodox symbolist, that it shows
that the people of Lucca loved hunting, even as the
people of Florence loved the sciences and crafts symbolised
on their belfry. But the two or three solitary
mannikins of the frieze of St. Michael exemplify not
the pleasures, but the terrors of the chase; or rather
they are not hunting, but being hunted by the wild
beasts all round; attacked rather than pursuing, flying
on their little horses from the unequal fight, or struggling
under the hug of bears, the grip of lions; never
does one of them carry off a dead creature or deal a
mortal blow. The wild beasts are masters of the
situation, the men mere intruders, speedily worsted;
and this is proved by the fact that where the wolves,
lions, and bears are not struggling with human beings,
they are devouring each another, the appearance of the
poor little scared men being only an interlude in the
everlasting massacre of one beast by another. The
people who worked this frieze may have pretended,
perhaps, that they were expressing the pleasures of
hunting; but what they actually realised was evidently
the horrors of a world given over to ravening creatures.
The porch sculptures of this and all the other churches
of Lucca remove all further doubt upon this point.
For here what human beings there lie under the belly
and in the claws (sometimes a mere horrid mangled
human head) of the lions and lionesses who project like
beamheads out of the wall or carry the porch columns
on their back: scowling, murderous creatures, with
which the twelfth and early thirteenth century ornamented
even houses and public tanks like Fonte Branda,
which less terrified generations adorned with personified
virtues. The nightmare of wild beasts is carried on
in the inside of the churches: there again, under the
columns of the pulpits are the lions and lionesses gnashing
their teeth, tearing stags and gazelles and playing
with human heads. And, to increase the horror, there
also loom on the capitals of the nave strange unknown
birds of prey, fantastic terrible vultures and griffins.
Everywhere massacre and nightmare in those churches
of Lucca. And the impression they made on my
mind was naturally strengthened by the recollection of
the similar and often more terrible carvings in other
places, Milan, Pavia, Modena, Volterra, the Pistoiese
and Lucchese hill-towns, in all other places rich
in pre-Franciscan art. Above all, there came to
my mind the image of the human figures which in
most of such pre-Franciscan places express the other
half of all this terror, the feelings of mankind in
this kingdom of wicked, mysterious wild beasts. I
allude to the terrible figures, crushed into dwarfs and
hunchbacks by the weight of porch columns and pulpits,
amid which the tragic creature, with broken spine
and starting eyes, of Sant' Ambrogio of Milan is,
through sheer horrified realisation, a sort of masterpiece.
But there are wild beasts, lions and lionesses,
among the works of thirteenth-century sculptors, and
lions and lionesses continue for a long time as ornaments
of pure Gothic architecture. Of course; but it was the
very nearness of the resemblance of these later creatures
that brought home to me the utterly different,
the uniform and extraordinary character, of those of
earlier date: the emblem was kept by the force of
tradition, but the meaning thereof was utterly changed.
The Pisani, for instance, carved lions and lionesses
under all their pulpits; some of them are merely looking
dignified, others devouring their prey, but they are
conceived by a semi-heraldic decorator or an intelligent
naturalist; nay, the spirit of St. Francis has entered
into the sculptors, the feeling for animal piety and
happiness, to the extent of representing the lionesses
as suckling and tenderly licking their whelps. The
men of that time cannot even conceive, in their newly
acquired faith and joy in God and His creatures, what
feelings must have been uppermost in the men who
first set the fashion of adorning churches with men-devouring
monsters.</p>

<p>Such were my impressions during those days spent
among the serene Lucchese churches and their terrible
emblems. And under their influence, thinking of
the times which had built the churches and carved
the emblems, there came to my memory a very curious
anecdote, unearthed by the learned ecclesiastical
historian Tocco, and consigned in his extremely suggestive
book on medi&aelig;val heresies. A certain priest
of Milan became so revered for his sanctity and learning,
and for the marvellous cures he worked, that the people
insisted on burying him before the high altar, and resorting
to his tomb as to that of a saint. The holy
man became even more undoubtedly saintly after his
death; and in the face of the miracles which were
wrought by his intercession, it became necessary to
proceed to his beatification. The Church was about to
establish his miraculous sainthood, when, in the official
process of collecting the necessary information, it was
discovered that the supposed saint was a Manichean
heretic, a <i>Catharus</i>, a believer in the wicked
Demiurgus, the creating Satan, the defeat of the spiritual
God, and the uselessness of the coming of Christ. It
was quite probable that he had spat upon the crucifix
as a symbol of the devil's triumph; it was quite
possible that he had said masses to Satan as the true
creator of all matter. Be this as it may, that priest's
half-canonised bones were publicly burnt and their
ashes scattered to the wind. The anecdote shows that
the Manichean heresies, some ascetic and tender, others
brutal and foul, had made their way into the most holy
places. And, indeed, when we come to think of it, no
longer startled by so extraordinary a revelation, this
was the second time that Christianity ran the risk of
becoming a dualistic religion&mdash;a religion, like some of
its Asiatic rivals, of pessimism, transcendentally spiritual
or cynically base according to the individual believer.
Nor is it surprising that such views, identical with
those of the transcendental theologians of the fourth
century, and equivalent to the philosophical pessimism
of our own day, as expounded particularly by Schopenhauer,
should have found favour among the best and
most thoughtful men of the early Middle Ages. In
those stern and ferocious, yet tender-hearted and most
questioning times, there must have been something
logically satisfying, and satisfying also to the harrowed
sympathies, in the conviction, if not in the dogma, that
the soul of man had not been made by the maker of
the foul and cruel world of matter; and that the suffering
of all good men's hearts corresponded with the
suffering, the humiliation of a mysteriously dethroned
God of the Spirit. And what a light it must have shed,
completely solving all terrible questions, upon the story
of Christ's martyrdom, so constantly uppermost in the
thoughts and feelings of medi&aelig;val men!</p>

<p>Now, the men who built Sant' Ambrogio<a href="#fn4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></a><a name="fn4r" id="fn4r"></a> and San
Miniato a Monte, who carved the stone nightmares,
the ravening lions, the squashed and writhing human
figures of the early Lombard and Tuscan churches,
were the contemporaries of that Manichean priest of
Milan, who, although a saint, had believed in the
triumph of the Devil and the wickedness of the Creator.
And among his fellow-heretics&mdash;those heretics lurking
everywhere, and most among the most religious&mdash;should
we not expect to find the mysterious guilds of Lombard
freemasons, and the craftsmen to whom they gradually
revealed their secrets, affirming in their stone symbolism
to the already initiated, and suggesting to the
uninitiated, their terrible creed of inevitable misery on
earth? Nay, can we not imagine some of them, even
as the Templars were accused of doing (and the Templars
were patrons, remember, of important guilds of masons),
propitiating the Great Enemy by service and ritual, proclaiming
his Power, even as the ancients propitiated the
divinities of darkness whom they hated? For the God of
Good, we can fancy them reasoning, the Pure Spirit who
will triumph when all this cruel universe goes to pieces,
can wish for no material altars, and can have no use for
churches. Or did not the idea of a dualism become
confused into a vacillating, contradictory notion of a
Power at once good and evil, something inscrutable,
unthinkable, but inspiring less confidence than terror?</p>

<p>Whatever the secret of those sculptured monsters,
this much is historically certain, that a dualistic, profoundly
pessimist belief had honeycombed Christianity
throughout Provence and Northern and Central Italy.
But for this knowledge it would be impossible to
explain the triumphant reception given to St. Francis
and his sublime, illogical optimism, his train of converted
wolves, sympathising birds, and saints and angels
mixing familiarly with mortal men. The Franciscan
revival has the strength and success of a reaction.
And in sweeping away the pessimistic terrors of mankind,
it swept away, by what is at least a strange
coincidence, the nightmare sculpture of the old Lombard
stonemasons.</p>

<p>What the things were which made room for the carved
virgins and saints, the lute-playing angels and nibbling
squirrels and twittering birds of Gothic sculpture, I
wish to put before the reader in one significant example.
The Cathedral of Ferrara is a building which, although
finished in the thirteenth century, had been begun and
consecrated so early as 1135, and the porch thereof, as
is frequently the case, appears to have been erected
earlier than other portions. Of this porch two pillars
are supported by life-sized figures, one bearded, one
beardless, both dressed in the girdled smock of the early
Middle Ages. The enormous weight of the porch is
resting, not conventionally (as in the antique caryatid)
on the head, but on the spine; and the head is protruded
forwards in a fearful effort to save itself, the
face most frightfully convulsed: another moment and
the spine must be broken and the head droop freely
down. Before the portals, but not supporting anything,
are six animals of red marble&mdash;a griffin, two lions, two
lionesses, or what seem such, and a second griffin. The
central lions are well preserved, highly realistic, but also
decorative; one of them is crushing a large ram, another
an ox, both creatures splendidly rendered. I imagine
these central lions to be more recent (having perhaps
replaced others) than their neighbours, which are obliterated
to the extent of being lions or lionesses only by
guesswork. These nameless feline creatures hold what
appear to be portions of sheep, one of them having at
its flank a curious excrescence like the stinging scorpion
of the Mithra groups. The griffins, on the other hand,
although every detail is rubbed out, are splendid in
power and expression&mdash;great lion-bodied creatures, with
gigantic eagle's beak, manifestly birds rather than beasts,
with the muscular neck and probably the movement of
a hawk. Like hawks, they have not swooped on to their
prey, but let themselves drop on to it, arriving not on
their belly like lions, but on their wings like birds.
The prey is about a fourth of the griffin's size. One of
the griffins has swooped down upon a wain, whose two
wheels just protrude on either side of him; the heads
of two oxen are under his paws, and the head, open
mouthed, with terrified streaming hair, of the driver;
beasts and men have come down flat on their knees.
The other griffin has captured a horse and his rider;
the horse has shied and fallen sideways beneath the
griffin's loins, with head protruding on one side and
hoofs on the other, the empty stirrup is still swinging.
The rider, in mail-shirt and Crusader's helmet, has been
thrown forward, and lies between the griffin's claws, his
useless triangular shield clasped tight against his breast.
Perhaps merely because the attitude of the two griffins
had to be symmetrical, and the horse and rider filled up
the space under their belly less closely than the cart,
oxen, and driver, there arises the suggestive fact that
the poor man and his bullocks are crushed more mercilessly
than the rich man and his horse. But be this as
it may, poor and rich, serf and knight, the griffin of
destiny encompasses and pounces upon each; and the
talons of evil pin down and the beak of misery rends
with impartial cruel certainty.</p>

<p>Such is the account of the world and man, of justice
and mercy, recorded for us by the stonemasons of
Ferrara.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>VI</h3>

<p>As with the emotional, the lyric element in Renaissance
art, so also with the narrative or dramatic; it
belongs not to the original, real, or at all events primitive
Christianity of the time when the Man Jesus
walked on earth in the body, but to that day when He
arose once more, no less a Christ, be sure, in the soul of
those men of the Middle Ages. The Evangelists had
never felt&mdash;why should they, good, fervent Jewish
laymen?&mdash;the magic of the baby Christ as it was felt
by those medi&aelig;val ascetics, suddenly reawakened to
human feeling. There is neither tenderness nor reverence
in the Gospels for the mother of the Lord; some
rather rough words on her motherhood; and that mention
in St. John, intended so evidently to bring the
Evangelist, or supposed Evangelist, into closer communion
with Christ, not to draw attention to Christ's
mother. Yet out of those slight, and perhaps almost
contemptuous indications, the Middle Ages have made
three or four perfect and wonderful types of glorified
womanhood: the Mother in adoration, the crowned,
enthroned Virgin, the Mater Gloriosa; the broken-hearted
Mother, Mater Dolorosa, as found at the foot of
the cross or fainting at the deposition therefrom; types
more complete and more immortal than that of any
Greek divinity; above all, perhaps, the mere young
mother holding the child for kindly, reverent folk to
look at, for the little St. John to play with, or alone,
looking at it, thinking of it in solitude and silence: the
whole lovingness of all creatures rising in a clear flame
to heaven. Nay, is not the suffering Christ a fresh
creation of the Middle Ages, made really to bear the
sorrows of a world more sorrowful than that of Judea?
That strange Christ of the Resurrection, as painted
occasionally by Angelico, by Pier della Francesca, particularly
in a wonderful small panel by Botticelli; the
Christ not yet triumphant at Easter, but risen waist-high
in the sepulchre, sometimes languidly seated on its
rim, stark, bloodless, with scarce seeing eyes, and the
motionless agony of one recovering from a swoon, enduring
the worst of all his martyrdom, the return to life in
that chill, bleak landscape, where the sparse trees bend
in the dawn wind; returning from death to a new, an
endless series of sufferings, even as that legend made
him answer the wayfaring Peter, <i>returning to be crucified
once more&mdash;iterum crucifigi</i>.</p>

<p>All this is the lyric side, on which, in art as in
poetry, there are as many variations as there are individual
temperaments, and the variety in Renaissance
art is therefore endless. Let us consider the narrative
or dramatic side, on which, as I have elsewhere tried to
show, all that could be done was done, only repetition
ensuing, very early in the history of Italian art, by the
Pisans, Giotto and Giotto's followers.</p>

<p>These have their counterpart, their precursors, in the
writers and reciters of devotional romances.</p>

<p>Among the most remarkable of these is the "Life of
the Magdalen," printed in certain editions of Frate Domenico
Cavalca's well known charming translations of St.
Jerome's "Lives of the Saints." Who the author may be
seems quite doubtful, though the familiar and popular
style might suggest some small burgher turned Franciscan
late in life. As the spiritual love lyrics of Jacopone
stand to the <i>Canzonieri</i> of Dante and of Dante's circle
of poets, so does this devout novel stand to Boccaccio's
more serious tales, and even to his "<i>Fiammetta</i>;" only,
I think that the relation of the two novelists is the
reverse of that of the poets; for, with an infinitely ruder
style, the biographer of the Magdalen, whoever he was,
has also an infinitely finer psychological sense than
Boccaccio. Indeed, this little novel ought to be reprinted,
like "Aucasin et Nicolette," as one of the
absolutely satisfactory works, so few but so exquisite,
of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>It is the story of the relations of Jesus with the
family of Lazarus, whose sister Mary is here identified
with the Magdalen; and it is, save for the account of
the Passion, which forms the nucleus, a perfect tissue of
inventions. Indeed, the author explains very simply
that he is narrating not how he knows of a certainty
that things did happen, but how it pleases him to think
that they might have happened. For the man puts his
whole heart in the story, and alters, amplifies, explains
away till his heart is satisfied. The Magdalen, for
instance, was not all the sort of woman that foolish
people think. If she took to scandalous courses, it was
only from despair at being forsaken by her bridegroom,
who left her on the wedding-day to follow Christ to the
desert, and who was no other than the Evangelist John.
Moreover, let no vile imputations be put upon it; in
those days, when everybody was so good and modest, it
took very little indeed (in fact, nothing which our wicked
times would notice at all) to get a woman into disrepute.</p>

<p>Judged by our low fourteenth-century standard, this
sinning Magdalen would have been only a little over-cheerful,
a little free, barely what in the fourteenth
century is called (the mere notion would have horrified
the house of Lazarus) <i>a trifle fast</i>; our unknown Franciscan&mdash;for
I take him to be a Franciscan&mdash;insists very
much on her having sung and whistled on the staircase,
a thing no modest lady of Bethany would then have
done; but which, my dear brethren, is after all&hellip;.</p>

<p>This sinful Magdalen, repenting of her sins, such as
they are, is living with her sister Mary and her brother
Lazarus; the whole little family bound to Jesus by the
miracle which had brought Lazarus back to life. Jesus
and his mother are their guests during Passion week;
and the awful tragedy of the world and of heaven
passes, in the anonymous narrative, across the narrow
stage of that little burgher's house. As in the art of
the fifteenth century, the chief emotional interest of
the Passion is thrown not on the Apostles, scarcely
on Jesus, but upon the two female figures, facing each
other as in some fresco of Perugino, the Magdalen and
the Mother of Christ. Facing one another, but how
different! This Magdalen has the terrific gesture of
despair of one of those colossal women of Signorelli's,
flung down, as a town by earthquake, at the foot of the
cross. She was pardoned "because she had loved much"&mdash;<i>quia
multo amavit</i>. The unknown friar knew what
<i>that</i> meant as well as his contemporary Dante, when
Love showed him the vision of Beatrice's death. Never
was there such heart-breaking as that of his heroine:
she becomes almost the chief personage of the Passion;
for she knows not merely all the martyrdom of the
Beloved, feels all the agonies of His flesh and His spirit,
but knows&mdash;how well!&mdash;that she has lost Him. Opposite
this terrible convulsive Magdalen, sobbing, tearing
her hair and rolling on the ground, is the other heart-broken
woman, the mother; but how different! She
remains maternal through her grief, with motherly
thoughtfulness for others; for to the real mother (how
different in this to the lover!) there will always remain
in the world some one to think of. She bridles her
sorrow; when John at last hesitatingly suggests that
they must not stay all night on Calvary, she turns
quietly homeward; and, once at home, tries to make
the mourners eat, tries to eat with them, makes them
take rest that dreadful night. For such a mother there
shall not be mere bitterness in death; and here follows
a most beautiful and touching invention: the glorified
Christ, returning from Limbo, takes the happy, delivered
souls to visit his mother.</p>

<p>"And Messer Gies&ugrave; having tarried awhile with them
in that place, said: 'Now let us go and make my mother
happy, who with most gentle tears is calling upon me.'
And they went forthwith, and came to the room where
our Lady was praying, and with gentle tears asking
God to give her back her son, saying it was to-day the
third day. And as she stayed thus, Messer Gies&ugrave; drew
near to her on one side, and said: 'Peace and cheerfulness
be with thee, Holy Mother.' And straightway she
recognised the voice of her blessed son, and opened her
eyes and beheld him thus glorious, and threw herself
down wholly on the ground and worshipped him. And
the Lord Jesus knelt himself down like her; and then
they rose to their feet and embraced one another most
sweetly, and gave each other peace, and then went and
sat together," while all the holy people from Limbo
looked on in admiration, and knelt down one by one,
first the Baptist, and Adam and Eve, and all the others,
saluting the mother of Christ, while the angels sang the
end of all sorrows.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>VII</h3>

<p>There would be much to say on this subject. One
might point out, for instance, not only that Dante has
made the lady he loved in his youth into the heroine&mdash;a
heroine smiling in fashion more womanlike than
theological&mdash;of his vision of hell and heaven; but what
would have been even less possible at any previous
moment of the world's history, he has interwoven
his theogony so closely with strands of most human
emotion and passion (think of that most poignant of
love dramas in the very thick of hell!), that, instead of
a representation, a chart, so to speak, of long-forgotten
philosophical systems, his poem has become a picture,
pattern within pattern, of the life of all things: flowers
blowing, trees waving, men and women moving and
speaking in densest crowds among the flaming rocks of
hell, the steps of purgatory, the planispheres of heaven's
stars making the groundwork of that wondrous tapestry.
But it is better to read Dante than to read about Dante,
so I let him be.</p>

<p>On the other hand, and lest some one take Puritanic
umbrage at my remarks on early Italian art, and deprecate
the notion that religious painters could be so
very human, I shall say a few parting words about the
religious painter, the saint <i>par excellence</i>, I mean the
Blessed Angelico. Heaven forbid I should attempt to
turn him into a brother Lippo, of the Landor or Browning
pattern! He was very far indeed, let alone from
profanity, even from such flesh and blood feeling as
that of Jacopone and scores of other blessed ones. He
was, emotionally, rather bloodless; and whatsoever
energy he had probably went in tussels with the technical
problems of the day, of which he knew much more,
for all his cloistered look, than I suspected when I wrote
of him before. Angelico, to return to the question, was
not a St. Francis, a Fra Jacopone. But even Angelico
had his passionately human side, though it was only the
humanness of a nice child. In a life of hard study,
and perhaps hard penance, that childish blessed one
nourished childish desires&mdash;desires for green grass
and flowers, for gay clothes,<a href="#fn5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></a><a name="fn5r" id="fn5r"></a> for prettily-dressed pink
and lilac playfellows, for the kissing and hugging in
which he had no share, for the games of the children
outside the convent gate. How human, how ineffably
full of a good child's longing, is not his vision of Paradise!
The gaily-dressed angels are leading the little
cowled monks&mdash;little baby black and white things,
with pink faces like sugar lambs and Easter rabbits&mdash;into
deep, deep grass quite full of flowers, the sort of
grass every child on this wicked earth has been cruelly
forbidden to wade in! They fall into those angels'
arms, hugging them with the fervour of children in the
act of <i>loving</i> a cat or a dog. They join hands with those
angels, outside the radiant pink and blue toy-box towers
of the celestial Jerusalem, and go singing "Round the
Mulberry Bush" much more like the babies in Kate
Greenaway's books than like the Fathers of the Church
in Dante. The joys of Paradise, for this dear man of God,
are not confined to sitting <i>ad dexteram domini</i>&hellip;.</p>

<p><i>Di questo nostro dolce Fratellino</i>; that line of Jacopone
da Todi, hymning to the child Christ, sums up, in
the main, the vivifying spirit of early Italian art; nay, is
it not this mingled emotion of tenderness, of reverence,
and deepest brotherhood which made St. Francis claim
sun and birds, even the naughty wolf, for brethren?
This feeling becomes embodied, above all, in the very
various army of charming angels; and more particularly,
perhaps, because Venice had no other means of
expression than painting, in the singing and playing
angels of the old Venetians. These angels, whether
they be the girlish, long-haired creatures, robed in
orange and green, of Carpaccio; or the naked babies,
with dimpled little legs and arms, and filetted silky
curls of Gian Bellini, seem to concentrate into music
all the many things which that strong pious Venice,
tongue-tied by dialect, had no other way of saying; and
we feel to this day that it sounds in our hearts and
attunes them to worship or love or gentle contemplation.
The sound of those lutes and pipes, of those
childish voices, heard and felt by the other holy persons
in those pictures&mdash;Roman knight Sebastian,
Cardinal Jerome, wandering palmer Roch, and all
the various lovely princesses with towers and palm
boughs in their hands&mdash;moreover brings them together,
unites them in one solemn blissfulness round the
enthroned Madonna. These are not people come together
by accident to part again accidentally; they
are eternal, part of a vision disclosed to the pious
spectator, a crowning of the Mass with its wax-lights
and songs.</p>

<p>But the Venetian playing and singing angels are
there for something more important still. Those
excellent old painters understood quite well that in
the midst of all this official, doge-like ceremony, it
was hard, very hard lines for the poor little Christ
Child, having to stand or lie for ever, for ever among
those grown-up saints, on the knees of that majestic
throning Madonna; since the oligarchy, until very late,
allowed no little playfellow to approach the Christ
Child, bringing lambs and birds and such-like, and
leading Him off to pick flowers as in the pictures of
those democratic Tuscans and Umbrians. None of
that silly familiarity, said stately Venetian piety. But
the painters were kinder. They incarnated their sympathy
in the baby music-making angels, and bade them
be friendly to the Christ Child. They are so; and
nowhere does it strike one so much as in that fine
picture, formerly called Bellini, but more probably
Alvise Vivarini, at the Redentore, where the Virgin,
in her lacquer-scarlet mantle, has ceased to be human
altogether, and become a lovely female Buddha in contemplation,
absolutely indifferent to the poor little
sleeping Christ. The little angels have been sorry.
Coming to make their official music, they have brought
each his share of heaven's dessert: a little offering of
two peaches, three figs, and three cherries on one stalk
(so precious therefore!), placed neatly, spread out to
look much, not without consciousness of the greatness
of the sacrifice. They have not, those two little
angels, forgotten, I am sure, the gift they have brought,
during that rather weary music-making before the
inattentive Madonna. They keep on thinking how
Christ will awake to find all those precious things,
and they steel their little hearts to the sacrifice. The
little bird who has come (invited for like reason) and
perched on the curtain bar, understands it all, respects
their feelings, and refrains from pecking.</p>

<p>Such is the heart of the saints, and out of it comes
the painted triumph of <i>El Magno Jesulino</i>.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>In a Florentine street through which I pass most days,
is a house standing a little back (the place is called
the Square of Purgatory), the sight of which lends to
that sordid street of stained palace backs, stables, and
dingy little shops, a certain charm and significance, in
virtue solely of three roses carved on a shield over a
door. The house is a humble one of the sixteenth
century, and its three roses have just sufficient resemblance
to roses, with their pincushion heads and straight
little leaves, for us to know them as such. Yet that
rude piece of heraldic carving, that mere indication
that some one connected with the house once thought
of roses, is sufficient, as I say, to give a certain pleasurableness
to the otherwise quite unpleasurable street.</p>

<p>This is by no means an isolated instance. In various
places, as emblems of various guilds or confraternities,
one meets similarly carved, on lintel or escutcheon,
sheaves of lilies, or what is pleasanter still, that
favourite device of the Renaissance (become well known
as the monogram of the painter Benvenuto Garofalo), a
jar with five clove-pinks. And on each occasion of
meeting them, that carved lily and those graven clove-pinks,
like the three roses in the Square of Purgatory,
have shed a charm over the street, given me a pleasure
more subtle than that derived from any bed of real
lilies, or pot of real clove-pinks, or bush of real roses;
colouring and scenting the street with this imaginary
colour and perfume. What train of thought has been
set up? It would be hard to say. Something too
vague to be perceived except as a whole impression of
pleasure; a half-seen vision, doubtless, of the real
flowers, of the places where they grow; perhaps even
a faint reminiscence, a dust of broken and pounded
fragments, of stories and songs into which roses enter,
or lilies, or clove-pinks.</p>

<p>Hereby hangs a whole question of &aelig;sthetics. Those
three stone roses are the type of one sort of imaginative
art; of one sort of art which, beyond or independent
of the charm of visible beauty, possesses a charm
that acts directly upon the imagination. Such charm,
or at least such interest, may be defined as the literary
element in art; and I should give it that name, did it
not suggest a dependence upon the written word which
I by no means intend to imply. It is the element
which, unlike actual representation, is possessed by
literature as well as by art; indeed, it is the essence of
the former, as actual representation is of the latter.
But it belongs to art, in the cases when it belongs to it
at all, not because the artist is in any way influenced
by the writer, but merely because the forms represented
by the artist are most often the forms of really
existing things, and fraught, therefore, with associations
to all such as know them; and because, also, the artist
who presents these forms is a human being, and as
such not only sees and draws, but feels and thinks;
because, in short, literature being merely the expression
of habits of thought and emotion, all such art as
deals with the images of real objects tends more or
less, in so far as it is a human being, to conform to its
type.</p>

<p>This is one kind of artistic imagination, this which
I have rudely symbolised in the symbol of the three
carved roses&mdash;the imagination which delights the mind
by holding before it some charming or uncommon
object, and conjuring up therewith a whole train of
feeling and fancy; the school, we might call it, of intellectual
decoration, of arabesques formed not of lines
and colours, but of associations and suggestions. And
to this school of the three carved roses in the Square
of Purgatory belong, among others, Angelico, Benozzo,
Botticelli, and all those Venetians who painted piping
shepherds, and ruralising magnificent ladies absorbed
in day-dreams.</p>

<p>But besides this kind of imagination in art, there is
another and totally different. It is the imagination of
how an event would have looked; the power of understanding
and showing how an action would have taken
place, and how that action would have affected the
bystanders; a sort of second-sight, occasionally rising
to the point of revealing, not merely the material aspect
of things and people, but the emotional value of the
event in the eyes of the painter. Thus, for instance,
Tintoret concentrated a beam of sunlight into the
figure of Christ before Pilate, not because he supposed
Christ to have stood in that sunlight, but because the
white figure, shining yet ghost-like, seemed to him,
perhaps unconsciously, to indicate the position of the
betrayed Saviour among the indifference and wickedness
of the world. Hence I would divide all imaginative art,
particularly that of the old Italian masters, into art
which stirs our own associations, and suggests to us
trains of thought and feeling perhaps unknown to the
artist, and art which exhibits a scene or event foreign
to ourselves, and placed before us with a deliberate
intention. Both are categories of imaginative activity
due to inborn peculiarities of character; but one of
them, namely, the suggestive, is probably spontaneous,
and quite unintentional, hence never asked for by the
public, nor sought after by the artist; while the other,
self-conscious and intentional, is therefore constantly
sought after by the artist, and bargained for by the
public. I shall begin with the latter, because it is the
recognised commodity: artistic imagination, as bought
and sold in the market, whether of good quality
or bad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The painters of the late thirteenth and early fourteenth
century, developing the meagre suggestions of Byzantine
decoration, incorporating the richer inventions of the
bas-reliefs of the Pisan sculptors and of the medallions
surrounding the earliest painted effigies of holy personages,
produced a complete set of pictorial themes
illustrative of Gospel history and of the lives of the
principal saints. These illustrative themes&mdash;definite
conceptions of situations and definite arrangements of
figures&mdash;became forthwith the whole art's stock,
universal and traditional; few variations were made
from year to year and from master to master, and
those variations resolved themselves continually back
into the original type. And thus on, through the
changes in artistic means and artistic ends, until the
Italian schools disappeared finally before the schools of
France and Flanders. Let us take a striking example.
The presentation of the Virgin remains unaltered in
main sentiment and significance of composition, despite
the two centuries and more which separate the Gaddi
from Titian and Tintoret, despite the complete change
in artistic aims and methods separating still more
completely the men of the fourteenth century from
the men of the sixteenth. The long flight of steps
stretching across the fresco in Santa Croce stretches
also across the canvas of the great Venetians; and the
little girl climbs up them alike, presenting her profile
to the spectator; although at the top of the steps there
is in one case a Gothic portal, and in the other a
Palladian portico, and at the bottom of the steps in
the fresco stand Florentines who might personally have
known Dante, and at the bottom of the steps in the
pictures the Venetian patrons of Aretino. Yet the
presentation of the little maiden to the High Priest
is quite equally conceivable in many other ways and
from many other points of view. As regards both
dramatic conception and pictorial composition, the
moment might have been differently chosen; the child
might still be with its parents or already with the priest;
and the flight of steps might have been replaced by the
court of the temple. Any man might have invented his
own representation of the occurrence. But the men of
the sixteenth century adhered scrupulously or indifferently
to the inventions of the men of the fourteenth.</p>

<p>This is merely one instance in a hundred. If we
summon up in our mind as many as we can of the
various frescoes and pictures representing the chief
incidents of Scripture history, we shall find that, while
there are endless differences between them with respect
to drawing, anatomy, perspective, light and shade,
colour and handling, there are but few and slight
variations as regards the conception of the situation
and the arrangement for the figures. In the Marriage
of the Virgin the suitors are dressed, sometimes in the
loose robe and cap with lappets of the days of Giotto,
and sometimes in the tight hose and laced doublet of
the days of Raphael and of Luini; but they break their
wands across their knees with the same gesture and
expression; and although the temple is sometimes close
at hand, and sometimes a little way off, the wedding
ceremony invariably takes place outside it, and not
inside. The shepherds in the Nativity are sometimes
young and sometimes old, but they always come in
broad daylight, and the manger by which the Virgin
is kneeling is always outside the stable, and always in
one corner of the picture. Again, whatever slight
difference there may be in the expression and gesture
of the apostles at the Last Supper, they are always
seated on one side only of a table facing the spectator,
with Judas alone on a stool on the opposite side. And
although there are two themes of the Entombment
of Christ, one where the body is stretched on the
ground, the other where it is being carried to the
sepulchre, the action is always out of doors, and never,
as might sometimes be expected, gives us the actual
burial in the vault. These examples are more than
sufficient. Yet I feel that any description in words is
inadequate to convey the extreme monotony of all
these representations, because the monotony is not
merely one of sentiment by selection of the dramatic
moment, but of the visible composition of the paintings,
of the outlines of the groups and the balancing of them.
A monotony so complete that any one of us almost
knows what to expect, in all save technical matters
and the choice of models, on being told that in such a
place there is an old Italian fresco, or panel, or canvas,
representing some principal episode of Gospel history.</p>

<p>The explanation of this fidelity to one theme of
representation in an art which was the very furthest
removed from any hieratic prescriptions, in an art
which was perpetually growing&mdash;and growing more
human and secular&mdash;must be sought for, I think, in
no peculiarities of spiritual condition or national
imagination, but in two facts concerning the merely
technical development of painting, and the results
thereof. These two facts are briefly: that at a given
moment&mdash;namely, the end of the thirteenth century
and the beginning of the fourteenth&mdash;there existed
just enough power of imitating nature to admit of the
simple indication of a dramatic situation, without
further realisation of detail; and that at this moment,
consequently, there originated such pictorial indications
of the chief dramatic situations as concerned the
Christian world. And secondly, that from then and
until well into the sixteenth century, the whole attention
of artists was engrossed in changing the powers
of indication into powers of absolute representation,
developing completely the drawing, anatomy, perspective,
colour, light and shade, and handling, which
Giotto and his contemporaries had possessed only in a
most rudimentary condition, and which had sufficed for
the creation of just such pictorial themes as they had
invented, and no more.</p>

<p>Let me explain myself further. The artists of the
fourteenth century, with the exception of Giotto himself&mdash;to
whose premature excellence none of his contemporaries
and disciples ever attained&mdash;give us, by
means of pictorial representation, just about the same
as could be given to us by the conventional symbolism
of writing. In describing a Giottesque fresco, or
panel, we are not stopped by the difficulty of rendering
visible effects in words, because the visible effects that
meet us are in reality so many words; so that, to
describe the picture, it almost suffices to narrate the
story, no arrangements of different planes and of light
and shade, no peculiarities of form, foreshortening,
colour, or texture requiring to be seen in order to be
fully understood. The artists of the fifteenth century&mdash;for
the Giottesques do little more than carry, without
developing them, the themes of Giotto into various
parts of Italy&mdash;work at adding to the art exactly
those qualities which belong exclusively to it, and
which baffle the mere written word: they acquire the
means, slowly and laboriously, of showing these events
no longer merely to the mind, but also to the eye;
they place these people in real space, in real relations
of distance and light, they give them a real body
which can stand and move, made of real flesh and
blood and bones, and covered with real clothes; they
turn these abstractions once more into realities like
the realities of nature whence they had been abstracted.
But the work of the fifteenth century does
not go beyond filling up the programme indicated by the
Giottesques; and it is only after the men of the
sixteenth century have been enabled to completely
realise all that the men of the fourteenth century had
indicated, that art, with Michelangelo, Tintoret, and
still more with the great painters of Spain and
Flanders, proceeds to encounter problems of foreshortening,
of light and shade, of atmospheric effect,
that could never have been imagined by the contemporaries
of Giotto, nor even by the contemporaries of
Ghirlandaio and the Bellini. Hence, throughout the
fifteenth century, while there is a steady development
of the artistic means required to realise those narrative
themes which the Giottesques had invented, there is
no introduction of any new artistic means unnecessary
for this result, but which, like the foreshortenings of
Michelangelo, and the light and shade of Tintoret, like
the still further additions to painting represented by
men like Velasquez and Rembrandt, could suggest new
treatment of the old histories and enable the well-known
events to be shown from totally new intellectual
standpoints, and in totally new artistic arrangements.
If we look into the matter, we shall recognise that the
monotony of representation throughout the Renaissance
can be amply accounted for without referring to the
fact, which, however, doubtless went for something,
that the men of the fifteenth century were too much
absorbed in the working out of details to feel any
desire for new pictorial versions of the stories of the
Gospel, and the lives of the Saints.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Giottesques&mdash;among whom I include
the immediate precursors, sculptors as well as painters,
of Giotto&mdash;put into their Scripture stories an amount
of logic, of sentiment, of dramatic and psychological
observation and imagination more than sufficient to
furnish out the works of three generations of later
comers. Setting aside Giotto himself, who concentrates
and diffuses the vast bulk of dramatic invention
as well as of artistic observation and skill, there is in
even the small and smallest among his followers, an
extraordinary happiness of individual invention of
detail. I may quote a few instances at random. It
would be difficult to find a humbler piece of work than
the so-called Tree of the Cross, in the Florentine
Academy: a thing like a huge fern, with medallion
histories in each frond, it can scarcely be considered a
work of art, and stands halfway between a picture and
a genealogical tree. Yet in some of its medallions
there is a great vivacity of imaginative rendering; for
instance, the Massacre of the Innocents represented by
a single soldier, mailed and hooded, standing before
Herod on a floor strewn with children's bodies, and
holding up an infant by the arm, like a dead hare,
preparing slowly to spit it on his sword; and the kiss
of Judas, the soldiers crowding behind, while the
traitor kisses Christ, seems to bind him hand and foot
with his embraces, to give him up, with that stealthy
look backwards to the impatient rabble&mdash;a representation
of the scene, infinitely superior in its miserable
execution to Angelico's Ave Rabbi! with its elaborate
landscape of towers and fruit trees. Again, in a series
of predella histories of the Virgin, in the same place,
also a very mediocre and anonymous work, there is
extraordinary charm in the conception of the respective
positions of Mary and Joseph at their wedding: he is
quite old and grey; she young, unformed, almost a
child, and she has to stand on two steps to be on his
level, raising her head with a beautiful, childlike
earnestness, quite unlike the conventional bridal
timidity of other painters. Leaving these unknown
mediocrities, I would refer to the dramatic value (besides
the great pictorial beauty) of an Entombment by
Giottino, in the corridor of the Uffizi: the Virgin does
not faint, or has recovered (thus no longer diverting
the attention from the dead Saviour to herself, as elsewhere),
and surrounds the head of her son with her
arms; the rest of the figures restrain themselves before
her, and wink with strange blinking efforts to keep
back their tears. Still more would I speak of two small
frescoes in the Baroncelli Chapel at Santa Croce, which
are as admirable in poetical conception as they are unfortunately
poor in artistic execution. One of them
represents the Annunciation to the Shepherds: they
are lying in a grey, hilly country, wrapped in grey
mists, their flock below asleep, but the dog vigilant,
sniffing the supernatural. One is hard asleep; the other
awakes suddenly, and has turned over and looks up
screwing his eyes at the angel, who comes in a pale
yellow winter sunrise cloud, in the cold, grey mist veined
with yellow. The chilliness of the mist at dawn, the
wonder of the vision, are felt with infinite charm. In
the other fresco the three kings are in a rocky place,
and to them appears, not the angel, but the little child
Christ, half-swaddled, swimming in orange clouds on a
deep blue sky. The eldest king is standing, and points
to the vision with surprise and awe; the middle-aged
one shields his eyes coolly to see; while the youngest,
a delicate lad, has already fallen on his knees, and is
praying with both hands crossed on his breast. For
dramatic, poetic invention, these frescoes can be surpassed,
poor as is their execution, only by Giotto's St.
John ascending slowly from the open grave, floating
upwards, with outstretched arms and illumined face,
to where a cloud of prophets, with Christ at their head,
enwraps him in the deep blue sky.</p>

<p>These pictorial themes elaborated by the painters of
the school of Giotto were not merely as good, in a way,
as any pictorial themes could be: simple, straightforward,
often very grand, so that the immediately following
generations could only spoil, but not improve
upon them; they were also, if we consider the matter,
the only pictorial representations of Scripture histories
possible until art had acquired those new powers of
foreshortening, and light and shade and perspective,
which were sought for only after the complete attainment
of the more elementary powers which the
Giottesques never fully possessed. Let us ask
ourselves how, in the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries,
any notable change in general arrangement of any
well-known Scripture subject could well have been
introduced; and, in order to do so, let us realise one
or two cases where the same subjects have been
treated by later masters. Tintoretto's Last Judgment,
where the Heavenly Hosts brood, poised on their
wings, above the river of hell which hurries the
damned down its cataracts, is impossible so long as
perspective and foreshortening will barely admit (as
is the case up to the end of the fifteenth century),
of figures standing firmly on the ground and being
separated into groups at various distances. In Rembrandt's
and Terburg's Adoration of the Shepherds,
the light emanates from the infant Christ; in Ribera's
magnificent Deposition from the Cross, the dead
Saviour and His companions are represented, not, as in
the Entombments of Perugino and Raphael, in the
open air, but in the ghastly light of the mouth of the
sepulchre. These are new variations upon the hackneyed
themes, but how were they possible so long as
the problems of light and shade were limited (as was
the case even with Leonardo), to giving the modelling,
rather in form than in colour, of a face or a limb?
One of the earliest and greatest innovations is Signorelli's
treatment of the Resurrection in the chapel
of San Brizio, at Orvieto; he broke entirely with the
tradition (exemplified particularly by Angelico) of
making the dead come fully fleshed and dressed as in
their lifetime from under the slabs of a burial place,
goaded by grotesque devils with the snouts and horns
of weasels and rams, with the cardboard masks of
those carnival mummers who gave the great pageant
of Hell mentioned by old chroniclers. But Signorelli's
innovation, his naked figures partially fleshed and
struggling through the earth's crust, his naked demons
shooting through the air and tying up the damned,
could not possibly have been executed or even conceived
until his marvellous mastery of the nude and of
the anatomy of movement had been obtained. Indeed,
wherever, in the art of the fifteenth century, we find a
beginning of innovation in the conception and arrangement
of a Scripture history, we shall find also the
beginning of the new technical method which has
suggested such a partial innovation. Thus, in the
case of one of the greatest, but least appreciated,
masters of the early Renaissance, Paolo Uccello. His
Deluge, in the frescoes of the green cloister of S. Maria
Novella, is wonderfully original as a whole conception;
and the figure clinging to the side of the ark, with
soaked and wind-blown drapery; the man in a tub
trying to sustain himself with his hands, the effort
and strain of the people in the water, are admirable
as absolute realisation of the scene. Again, in the
Sacrifice of Noah, there is in the foreshortened figure
of God, floating, brooding, like a cloud, with face downward
and outstretched hands over the altar, something
which is a prophecy, and more than a prophecy, of
what art will come to in the Sixtine and the Loggie.
But these inventions are due to Uccello's special and
extraordinary studies of the problems of modelling and
foreshortening; and when his contemporaries try to
assimilate his achievements, and unite them with the
achievements of other men in other special technical
directions, there is an end of all individual poetical
conception, and a relapse into the traditional arrangements;
as may be seen by comparing the Bible stories
of Paolo Uccello with those of Benozzo Gozzoli at Pisa.</p>

<p>It is not wonderful that the painters of the fifteenth
century should have been satisfied with repeating the
themes left by the Giottesques. For the Giottesques
had left them, besides this positive heritage, a negative
heritage, a programme to fill up, of which it is difficult
to realise the magnitude. The work of the Giottesques
is so merely poetic, or at most so merely decorative in
the sense of a mosaic or a tapestry, and it is in the
case of Giotto and one or two of his greatest contemporaries,
particularly the Sienese, so well-balanced
and satisfying as a result of its elementary nature
that we are apt to overlook the fact that everything
in the way of realisation as opposed to indication,
everything distinguishing the painting of a story from
the mere telling thereof, remained to be done. And
such realisation could be attained only through a
series of laborious failures. It is by comparing some
of the later Giottesques themselves, notably the Gaddi
with Giotto, that we bring home to ourselves, for
instance, that Giotto did not, at least in his finest
work at Florence, attempt to model his frescoes in
colour. Now the excessive ugliness of the Gaddi
frescoes at St. Croce is largely due to the effort to
make form and boss depend, as in nature, upon colour.
Giotto, in the neighbouring Peruzzi and Bardi chapels,
is quite satisfied with outlining the face and draperies
in dark paint, and laying on the colour, in itself
beautiful, as a child will lay it on to a print or outline
drawing, filling up the lines, but not creating
them. I give this as a solitary instance of one of the
first and most important steps towards pictorial
realisation which the great imaginative theme-inventors
left to their successors. As a fact, the items
at which the fifteenth century had to work are too
many to enumerate; in many cases each man or
group of men took up one particular item, as perspective,
modelling, anatomy, colour, movement, and
their several subdivisions, usually with the result of
painful and grotesque insistency and onesidedness,
from the dreadful bag of bones anatomies of Castagno
and Pollaiolo, down to the humbler, but equally necessary,
architectural studies of Francesco di Giorgio.
Add to this the necessity of uniting the various attainments
of such specialists, of taming down these often
grotesque monomaniacs, of making all these studies
of drawing, anatomy, colour, modelling, perspective,
&amp;c., into a picture. If that picture was lacking in
individual poetic conception; if those studies were
often intolerably silly and wrong-headed from the
intellectual point of view; if the old themes were not
only worn threadbare, but actually maltreated, what
wonder? The themes were there, thank Heaven! no
one need bother about them; and no one did. Moreover,
as I have already pointed out, no one could have
added anything, save in the personal sentiment of the
heads, the hands, the tilt of the figure, or the quality
of the form. Everything which depends upon dramatic
conception, which is not a question of form or sentiment,
tended merely to suffer a steady deterioration.
Thus, nearly two hundred years after Giotto, Ghirlandaio
could find nothing better for his frescoes in St.
Trinit&agrave; than the arrangement of Giotto's St. Francis,
with the difference that he omitted all the more delicate
dramatic distinctions. I have already alluded to the
poetic conception of an early Marriage of the Virgin
in the Florence Academy; that essential point of the
extreme youth of Mary was never again attended to,
although the rest of the arrangement was repeated for
two centuries. Similarly, no one noticed or reproduced
the delicate distinctions of action which Gaddi had
put into his two Annunciations of the Cappella
Baroncelli; the shepherds henceforth sprawled no
matter how; and the scale of expression in the vision
of the Three Kings was not transferred to the more
popular theme of their visit to the stable at Bethlehem.
In Giotto's Presentation at the Temple in the Arena
chapel at Padua, the little Mary is pushed up the
steps by her mother; in the Baroncelli frescoes the
little girl, ascending gravely, turns round for a minute
to bless the children at the foot of the steps. Here
are two distinct dramatic conceptions, the one more
human, the other more majestic; both admirable.
The fifteenth century, nay, the fourteenth, took no
account of either; the Virgin merely went up the
steps, connected by no emotion with the other characters,
a mere little doll, as she is still in the big
pictures of Titian and Tintoret, and quite subordinate
to any group of richly dressed men or barebacked
women. It is difficult to imagine any miracle quite so
dull as the Raising of the King's Son in the Brancacci
Chapel; its dramatic or undramatic foolishness is
surpassed only by certain little panels of Angelico,
with fiery rain and other plagues coming down upon
the silly blue and pink world of dolls.</p>

<p>A satisfactory study of the lack of all dramatic invention
of the painters of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries is afforded by the various representations of
the Annunciation of the Virgin, one of the favourite
themes of the early Renaissance. It never seems to
have occurred to any one that the Virgin and the
Archangel might be displayed otherwise than each in
one corner of the picture. Such a composition as
that of Rossetti's Ancilla Domini, where the Virgin
cowers on her bed as the angel floats in with flames
round his feet; such a suggestion as that of the unfinished
lily on the embroidery frame, was reserved
for our sceptical and irreverent, but imaginative
times.</p>

<p>The variety in these Annunciations depends, as I
have remarked, not upon a new dramatic conception,
producing, as in the case of Rossetti's, a new visible
arrangement; but upon the particular kind of form
preferred by the artist, and the particular kind of
expression common in his pictures; the variety, I may
add, is, with one or two exceptions, a variety in inertness.
Let us look at a few, taking merely those in one
gallery, the Uffizi. The Virgin, in that superb piece of
gilding by Simone Martini (did those old painters ever
think of the glorified evening sky when they devised
such backgrounds?), is turning away from the angel in
sheer loathing and anger, a great lady feeling sick at
the sudden intrusion of a cad. In a picture by Angelo
Gaddi, she is standing with her hand on her chest,
just risen from her chair, like a prima donna going to
answer an <i>encore</i>&mdash;a gracious, but not too eager recognition
of an expected ovation. In one by Cosimo
Rossetti she lifts both hands with shocked astonishment
as the angel scuddles in; in the lovely one, with
blue Alpine peaks and combed-out hair, now given to
Verocchio, she raises one hand with a vacant smile, as
if she were exclaiming, "Dear me! there's that angel
again." The one slight deviation from the fixed type
of Annunciation, Angelico's, in a cell at St. Mark's,
where he has made the Virgin kneel and the angel
stand, merely because he had painted another Annunciation
with a kneeling angel a few doors off, is due to no
dramatic inspiration. The angel standing upright with
folded arms (how different from Rossetti's standing
angel!) while the Virgin kneels, instead of kneeling to
her as, according to etiquette, results merely in an
impression that this silly, stolid, timid little <i>Ancilla
Domini</i> (here again one thinks of Rossetti's cowering
and dazed Virgin), has been waiting for some time in
that kneeling attitude, and that the Archangel has come
by appointment.</p>

<p>Among this crowd of unimpressive, nay brainless,
representations of one of the grandest and sweetest of
all stories, there stand out two&mdash;an Annunciation by
Signorelli, a small oil painting in the Uffizi, and one by
Botticelli,<a href="#fn6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></a><a name="fn6r" id="fn6r"></a> a large tempera picture in the same room.
But they stand out merely because the one is the
work of the greatest early master of form and movement,
or rather the master whose form and movement
had a peculiar quality of the colossal; and the other
is the work of the man, of all Renaissance painters,
whose soul seems to have known most of human, or
rather feminine wistfulness, and sorrow, and passion.</p>

<p>The little panel by Signorelli (the lowest compartment,
divided into three, of an altar-piece) is perhaps,
besides the Orvieto <i>Resurrection</i>, his most superb and
poetical work. The figures, only three inches high,
have his highest quality of powerful grandeur, solemnly
rustic in the kneeling shepherds&mdash;solemn in the very
swagger, hand on hip, of the parti-coloured bravoes of
the Magi; the landscape, only a few centimetres across,
is one of the amplest and most austere that ever has
been painted: a valley, bounded by blue hills and dark
green ilex groves, wide, silent, inhabited by a race
larger and stronger than the human, with more than
human passions, but without human speech. In it the
Virgin is seated beneath a portico, breathing, as such
creatures must breathe, the vast greenness, the deep
evening breeze. And to her comes bounding, with
waving draperies and loosened hair, the Archangel,
like a rushing wind, the wind which the strong woman
is quietly inhaling. There is no religious sentiment
here, still less any human: the Madonna bows gravely
as one who is never astonished; and, indeed, this race
of giants, living in this green valley, look as if nothing
could ever astonish them&mdash;walking miracles themselves,
and in constant relation with the superhuman.</p>

<p>We must forget all such things in turning to that
Annunciation of Botticelli. The angel has knelt down
vehemently, but drawn himself back, frightened at his
own message; moved overmuch and awed by what he has
to say, and her to whom he must say it; lifting a hand
which seems to beg patience, till the speech which is
throbbing in his heart can pass his lips; eagerness defeating
itself, passionate excitement turned into awe in
this young, delicate, passionate, and imaginative creature.
He has not said the word; but she has understood.
She has seen him before; she knows what he means, this
vehement, tongue-tied messenger; and at his sight she
reels, her two hands up, the beating of her own blood
too loud in her ears, a sudden mist of tears clouding
her eyes. This is no simple damsel receiving the
message, like Rossetti's terrified and awe-stricken girl,
that she is the handmaid of the Lord. This is the nun
who has been waiting for years to become Christ's own
bride, and receives at length the summons to him, in a
tragic overpowering ecstasy, like Catherine in Sodoma's
fresco, sinking down at the touch of the rays from
Christ's wounds. Nay, this is, in fact, the mere long-loving
woman, suddenly overcome by the approach of
bliss ever hungered for, but never expected, hearing
that it is she who is the beloved; and the angel is the
knight's squire, excited at the message he has to carry,
but terrified at the sight of the woman to whom he
must carry it, panting with the weight of another man's
love, and learning, as he draws his breath to say those
words, what love is himself.</p>

<p>The absence of individual invention, implying the
absence of individual dramatic realisation, strikes one
more than anywhere in the works of Angelico; and
most of all in his frescoes of the cells of St. Mark's.
For, while these are evidently less cared for as art,
indeed scarcely intended, in their hasty execution, to
be considered as paintings at all, they are more strictly
religious in intention than any other of Angelico's
works; indeed, perhaps, of all paintings in the world,
the most exclusively devoted to a religious object.
They are, in fact, so many pages of Scripture stuck up,
like texts in a waiting-room, in the cells of the convent:
an adjunct to the actual written or printed
Bible of each monk. For this reason we expect them
to possess what belongs so completely to the German
engravers of D&uuml;rer's school, the very essential of
illustrative art&mdash;imaginative realisation of the scenes,
an attempt to seize the attention and fill it with the
subject. This is by no means the case: for Angelico,
although a saint, was a man of the fifteenth century,
and, despite all his obvious efforts, he was not a real
follower of Giotto. What impressiveness of actual
artistic arrangement these frescoes really possess, is
due, I think, to no imaginative effort of the artist, but
to the exigencies of the place; as any similar impressiveness
is due in Signorelli's Annunciation to the
quality of his form, and in Botticelli's Annunciation to
the pervading character of his heads and gestures.
These pale angels and St. Dominicks and Magdalens,
these diaphanous, dazzling Christs and Virgins of
Angelico's, shining out of the dark corner of the cell
made darker, deeper, by the dark green or inky purple
ground on which they are painted, are less the spiritual
conception of the painter than the accidental result of
the darkness of the place, where lines must be simple
and colours light, if anything is to be visible. For in
the more important frescoes in the corridors and
chapter-room, where the light is better, there is a
return to Angelico's hackneyed vapid pinks and blues
and lilacs, and a return also to his niminy-piminy lines,
to all the wax-doll world of the missal painter. The fine
fresco of St. Dominick at the foot of the cross, which
seems to constitute an exception to this rule, really
goes to prove it, since it is intended to be seen very
much like the cell frescoes: white and black on a blue
ground at the end of the first corridor, a thing to be
looked at from a great distance, to impress the lay
world that sees it at the cloister and from outside the
convent railing. The cell frescoes are, I have said, the
most exclusively religious paintings in the world, since
they are to the highest degree, what all absolutely pious
art must be, <i>aids to devotion</i>. Their use is to assist
the monk in that conjuring up of the actual momentary
feelings, nay, sensations, of the life of Christ which
is part of his daily duty. They are such stimuli as the
Church has given sometimes in an artistic, sometimes
in a literary form, to an imagination jaded by the
monotonous contemplation of one subject, or overexcited
to the extent of rambling easily to another:
they are what we fondly imagine will be the portraits
of the dear dead which we place before us, forgetting
that after a while we look without seeing, or see without
feeling. That this is so, that these painted Gospel
leaves stuck on the cell walls are merely such mechanical
aids to devotion, explains the curious and
startling treatment of some of the subjects, which are
yet, despite the seeming novelty and impressiveness,
very cold, undramatic, and unimaginative. Thus, there
is the fresco of Christ enthroned, blindfold, with alongside
of Him a bodiless scoffing head, with hat raised,
and in the act of spitting; buffeting hands, equally
detached from any body, floating also on the blue background.
There is a Christ standing at the foot of the
cross, but with his feet in a sarcophagus, the column
of the flagellation monumentally or heraldically on
one side, the lance of Longinus on the other; and
above, to the right, the floating face of Christ being
kissed by that of Judas; to the left the blindfold
floating head of Christ again, with the floating head of
a soldier spitting at Him; and all round buffeting and
jibing hands, hands holding the sceptre of reed, and
hands counting out money; all arranged very much
like the nails, hammer, tweezers and cock on roadside
crosses; each a thing whereon to fix the mind, so as to
realise that kiss of Judas, that spitting of the soldiers,
those slaps; and to hear, if possible, the chink of the
pieces of silver that sold our Lord. How different,
these two pictorial dodges of the purely mechanical
Catholicism of the fifteenth century from the tender
or harrowing gospel illustrations, where every detail
is conceived as happening in the artist's own town
and to his own kinsfolk, of the Lutheran engravers
of the school of D&uuml;rer!</p>

<p>Thus things go on throughout the fifteenth century,
and, indeed, deep into the sixteenth, where traditional
arrangement and individual conception overlap, according
as a new artistic power does or does not call forth
a new dramatic idea. I have already alluded to the
fact that the Presentation of the Virgin remains the
same, so far as arrangement is concerned, in the pictures
of Titian and Tintoret as in the frescoes of Giotto and
Gaddi. Michelangelo's Creation of Adam seems still
inherited from an obscure painter in the "Green
Cloister," who inherited it from the Pisan sculptors.
On the other hand, the Resurrection and Last Judgment
of Signorelli at Orvieto, painted some years
earlier, constitutes in many of its dramatic details a
perfectly original work. Be this as it may, and however
frequent the recurrence of old themes, with the
sixteenth century commences the era of new individual
dramatic invention. Michelangelo's Dividing of the
Light from the Darkness, where the Creator broods
still in chaos, and commands the world to exist; and
Raphael's Liberation of St. Peter, with its triple
illumination from the moon, the soldier's torches and
the glory of the liberating angel, are witnesses that
henceforward each man may invent for himself,
because each man is in possession of those artistic
means which the Giottesques had indicated and the
artists of the fifteenth century had laboriously acquired.
And now, the Giottesque programme being fulfilled, art
may go abroad and seek for new methods and effects,
for new dramatic conceptions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>III</h3>

<p>The other day, walking along the river near Careggi
(with its memories of Lorenzo dei Medici and his
Platonists), close to the little cupola and loggia built
by Ghirlandaio, I came upon a strip of new grass,
thickly whitened with daisies, beneath the poplars
beginning to yellow with pale sprouting leaves. And
immediately there arose in my mind, by the side of this
real grass and real budding of trees, the remembrance
of certain early Renaissance pictures: the rusty, green,
stencilled grass and flowers of Botticelli, the faded
tapestry work of Angelico; making, as it were, the
greenness greener, the freshness fresher, of that real
grass and those real trees. And not by the force of
contrast, but rather by the sense that as all this appears
to me green and fresh in the present, so likewise did it
appear to those men of four centuries ago: the fact of
their having seen and felt, making me, all the more, see
and feel.</p>

<p>This is one of the peculiarities of rudimentary art&mdash;of
the art of the early Renaissance as well as of that of
Persia and India, of Constantinople, of every peasant
potter all through the world: that, not knowing very
well its own aims, it fills its imperfect work with suggestion
of all manner of things which it loves, and tries
to gain in general pleasurableness what it loses in actual
achievement; and lays hold of us, like fragments of
verse, by suggestiveness, quite as much as by pictorial
realisation. And upon this depends the other half of
the imaginative art of the Renaissance, the school of
intellectual decoration, of arabesques formed, not of
lines and of colours, but of associations and suggestions.</p>

<p>The desire which lies at the bottom of it&mdash;a desire
masked as religious symbolism in the old mosaicists
and carvers and embroiderers&mdash;is the desire to paint
nice things, in default of painting a fine picture. The
beginning of such attempts is naturally connected with
the use of gilding; whether those gold grounds of the
panel pictures of the fourteenth century represented to
the painters only a certain expenditure of gold foil, or
whether (as I have suggested, but I fear fantastically)
their streakings and veinings of coppery or silvery
splendour, their stencillings of rays and dots and fretwork,
their magnificent inequality and variety of brown
or yellow or greenish effulgence, were vaguely connected
in the minds of those men with the splendour
of the heaven in which the Virgin and the Saints really
dwell. It is the cunning use of this gilding, of tools
for ribbing and stencilling and damascening, which
give half of their marvellous exotic loveliness to Simone
Martini's frescoes at Assisi and his Annunciation of the
Florentine Gallery; this, and the feeling for wonderful
gold woven and embroidered stuffs, like that white
cloth of gold of the kneeling angel, fit, in its purity and
splendour, for the robe of Grail king. The want of
mechanical dexterity, however, prevented the Giottesques
from doing very much in the decorative line
except in conjunction with the art&mdash;perhaps quite
separate from that of the painter, and exercised by a
different individual&mdash;of the embosser and gilder.</p>

<p>It is with the fifteenth century that begins, in Italy
as in Flanders (we must think of the carved stonework,
the Persian carpets, the damascened armour, the brocade
dresses of Van Eyck's and Memling's Holy Families),
the deliberate habit of putting into pictures as much as
possible of the beautiful and luxurious things of this
world. The house of the Virgin, originally a very
humble affair, or rather, in the authority of the early
Giottesques, a <i>no place, nowhere</i>, develops gradually into
a very delightful residence in the choicest part of the
town, or into a pleasantly situated villa, like the one
described in the Decameron, commanding a fine view.
The Virgin's bedchamber, where we are shown it, as,
for instance, in Crivelli's picture in the National Gallery,
is quite as well appointed in the way of beautiful bedding,
carving, and so forth, as the chamber of the lady
of John Arnolfini of Lucca in Van Eyck's portrait.
Outside it, as we learn from Angelico, Cosimo Rosselli,
Lippi, Ghirlandaio, indeed, from almost every Florentine
painter, stretches a pleasant portico, decorated in
the Ionic or Corinthian style, as if by Brunellesco or
Sangallo, with tesselated floor, or oriental carpet, and
usually a carved or gilded desk and praying stool;
while the privacy of the whole place is guarded by a
high wall, surmounted by vases, overtopped by cypresses,
and in whose shelter grows a row of well-kept roses
and lilies. Sometimes this house, as I have said,
becomes a villa, as is the case, not unfrequently, with
the Lombards, who love to make the angel appear on
the flowery grass against a background of Alpine peaks,
such as you see them, rising blue and fairylike from the
green ricefields about Pavia. Crivelli, however, though
a Lombard, prefers a genteel residence in town, the
magnificent Milan of Galeazzo and Filippo Visconti.
He gives us a whole street, where richly dressed and
well peruked gentlemen look down from the terraces,
duly set with flower-pots, of houses ornamented with
terra-cotta figures and medallions like those of the
hospital at Milan. In this street the angel of the
Annunciation is kneeling, gorgeously got up in silks
and brocades, and accompanied by a nice little bishop
carrying a miniature town on a tray. The Virgin
seems to be receiving the message through the window
or the open door. She has a beautiful bed with a red
silk coverlet, some books, and a shelf covered with plates
and preserve jars. This evident appreciation of jam,
as one of the pleasant things of this world, corresponds
with the pot of flowers on the window, the bird-cage
hanging up: the mother of Christ must have the little
tastes and luxuries of a well-to-do burgess's daughter.
Again, the cell of St. Jerome, painted some thirty years
later by Carpaccio, in the Church of the Slavonians,
contains not only various convenient and ornamental
articles of furniture, but a collection of nick-nacks,
among which some antique bronzes are conspicuous.</p>

<p>The charm in all this is not so much that of the
actual objects themselves; it is that of their having
delighted those people's minds. We are pleased by
their pleasure, and our imagination is touched by their
fancy. The effect is akin to that of certain kinds of
poetry, not the dramatic certainly, where we are pleased
by the mere suggestion of beautiful things, and quite
as much by finding in the poet a mind appreciative and
desirous of them, constantly collecting them and enhancing
them by subtle arrangements; it is the case
with much lyric verse, with the Italian folk-rhymes,
woven out of names of flowers and herbs, with some of
Shakespeare's and Fletcher's songs, with the "Allegro"
and "Penseroso," Keats, some of Heine, and, despite a
mixture of unholy intention, Baudelaire. The great
master thereof in the early Renaissance, the lyrist, if
I may use the word, of the fifteenth century, is of
course Botticelli. He is one of those who most persistently
introduce delightful items into their works:
elaborately embroidered veils, scarves, and gold fringes.
But being a man of fine imagination and most delicate
sense of form, he does not, like Angelico or Benozzo or
Carpaccio, merely stick pretty things about; he works
them all into his strange arabesque, half intellectual,
half physical. Thus the screen of roses<a href="#fn7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></a><a name="fn7r" id="fn7r"></a> behind certain
of his Madonnas, forming an exquisite Morris
pattern with the greenish-blue sky interlaced; and
those beautiful, carefully-drawn branches of spruce-fir
and cypress, lace-like in his Primavera; above all, that
fan-like growth of myrtles, delicately cut out against
the evening sky, which not merely print themselves as
shapes upon the mind, but seem to fill it with a scent
of poetry.</p>

<p>This pleasure in the painter's pleasure in beautiful
things is connected with another quality, higher and
rarer, in this sort of imaginative art. It is our appreciation
of the artist's desire for beauty and refinement,
of his search for the exquisite. Herein, to my mind,
lies some of the secret of Botticelli's fantastic grace; the
explanation of that alternate or rather interdependent
ugliness and beauty. Botticelli, as I have said elsewhere,
must have been an admirer of the grace and
sentiment of Perugino, of the delicacy of form of certain
Florentine sculptors&mdash;Ghiberti, and those who proceed
from him, Desiderio, Mino, and particularly the
mysterious Florentine sculptor of Rimini; and what
these men have done or do, Botticelli attempts, despite
or (what is worse) by means of the realistic drawing
and ugly models of Florence, the mechanism and
arrangement of coarse men like the Pollaiolos. The
difficulty of attaining delicate form and sentiment with
such materials&mdash;it cannot be said to have been attained
in that sense by any other early Tuscan painter, not
even Angelico or Filippo Lippi&mdash;makes the desire but
the keener, and turns it into a most persevering and
almost morbid research. Thence the extraordinary ingenuity
displayed, frequently to the detriment of the
work, in the arrangement of hands (witness the tying,
clutching hands, with fingers bent curiously in intricate
knots, of the Calumny of Apelles), and of drapery; in
the poising of bodies and selection of general outline.
This search for elegance and grace, for the refined and
unhackneyed, is frequently baffled by the ugliness of
Botticelli's models, and still more by Botticelli's deficient
knowledge of anatomy and habit of good form.
But, when not baffled, this desire is extraordinarily
assisted by those very defects. This great decorator,
who uses the human form as so much pattern element,
mere lines and curves like those of a Raffaelesque
arabesque, obtains with his imperfect, anatomically
defective, and at all events ill-fashioned figures, a far-fetched
and poignant grace impossible to a man dealing
with more perfect elements. For grace and distinction,
which are qualities of movement rather than of form,
do not strike us very much in a figure which is originally
well made. The momentary charm of movement
is lost in the permanent charm of form; the creature
could not be otherwise than delightful, made as it is;
and we thus miss the sense of selection and deliberate
arrangement, the sense of beauty as movement, that is,
as grace. Whereas, in the case of defective form, any
grace that may be obtained affects us <i>per se</i>. It need
not have been there; indeed, it was unlikely to be
there; and hence it obtains the value and charm of
the unexpected, the rare, the far-fetched. This, I
think, is the explanation of the something of exotic
beauty that attaches to Botticelli: we perceive the
structural form only negatively, sufficiently to value
all the more the ingenuity of arrangement by which it
is made to furnish a beautiful outline and beautiful
movement; and we perceive the great desire thereof.
If we allow our eye to follow the actual structure of
the bodies, even in the Primavera, we shall recognise
that not one of these figures but is downright deformed
and out of drawing. Even the Graces have arms and
shoulders and calves and stomachs all at random; and
the most beautiful of them has a slice missing out of
her head. But if, instead of looking at heads, arms,
legs, bodies, separately, and separate from the drapery,
we follow the outline of the groups against the background,
drapery clinging or wreathing, arms intertwining,
hands combed out into wonderful fingers; if
we regard these groups of figures as a pattern stencilled
on the background, we recognise that no pattern could
be more exquisite in its variety of broken up and
harmonised lines. The exquisite qualities of all graceful
things, flowers, branches, swaying reeds, and certain
animals like the stag and peacock, seem to have been
abstracted and given to these half-human and wholly
wonderful creatures&mdash;these thin, ill put together, unsteady
youths and ladies. The ingenious grace of
Botticelli passes sometimes from the realm of art to
that of poetry, as in the case of those flowers, with
stiff, tall stems, which he places by the uplifted foot of
the middle Grace, thus showing that she has trodden
over it, like Virgil's Camilla, without crushing it.
But the element of sentiment and poetry depends
in reality upon the fascination of movement and
arrangement; fascination seemingly from within, a result
of exquisite breeding in those imperfectly made
creatures. It is the grace of a woman not beautiful,
but well dressed and moving well; the exquisiteness of
a song sung delicately by an insufficient or defective
voice: a fascination almost spiritual, since it seems to
promise a sensitiveness to beauty, a careful avoidance
of ugliness, a desire for something more delicate, a
reverse of all things gross and accidental, a possibility
of perfection.</p>

<p>This imagination of pleasant detail and accessory,
which delights us by the intimacy into which we are
brought with the artist's innermost conception, develops
into what, among the masters of the fifteenth
century, I should call the imagination of the fairy tale.
A small number of scriptural and legendary stories
lend themselves quite particularly to the development
of such beautiful accessory, which soon becomes the
paramount interest, and vests the whole with a totally
new character: a romantic, childish charm, the charm
of the improbable taken for granted, of the freedom to
invent whatever one would like to see but cannot, the
charm of the fairy story. From this unconscious altering
of the value of certain Scripture tales, arises a romantic
treatment which is naturally applied to all other
stories, legends of saints, biographical accounts, Decameronian
tales (Mr. Leyland once possessed some Botticellian
illustrations of the tale of Nastagio degli
Onesti, the hero of Dryden's "Theodore and Honoria,"
a sort of pendant to the Griseldis attributed to Pinturicchio),
and mythological episodes: a new kind of
invention, based upon a desire to please, and as different
from the invention of the Giottesques as the Arabian
Nights are different from Homer.</p>

<p>I have said that it begins with the unconscious
altering of the values of certain scriptural stories,
owing to the preponderance of detail over accessory.
The chief example of this is the Adoration of the Magi.
In the paintings of the Giottesques, and in the paintings
of the serious, or duller, masters of the fifteenth century&mdash;Ghirlandaio,
Rosselli, Filippino, those for whom
the fairy tale could exist no more than for Michelangelo
or Andrea del Sarto&mdash;the chief interest in this
episode is the Holy Family, the miraculous Babe whom
these great folk came so far to see. The fourteenth century
made very short work of the kings, allowing them
a minimum of splendour; and those of the fifteenth century,
who cared only for artistic improvement, copied
slavishly, giving the kings their retinue only as they
might have introduced any number of studio models
or burgesses aspiring at portraits, after the fashion of
the Brancacci and S. Maria Novella frescoes, where
spectators of miracles make a point never to look at the
miraculous proceedings. But there were men who felt
differently: the men who loved splendour and detail.
To Gentile da Fabriano, that wonderful man in whom
begins the colour and romance of Venetian painting,<a href="#fn8"><sup><small>8</small></sup></a><a name="fn8r" id="fn8r"></a>
the adoration of the kings could not possibly be what
it had been for the Giottesques, or what it still was for
Angelico. The Madonna, St. Joseph, the child Christ
did not cease to be interesting: he painted them with
evident regard, gave the Madonna a beautiful gold
hem to her dress, made St. Joseph quite unusually
amiable, and shed a splendid gilt glory about the child
Christ. But to him the wonderful part of the business
was not the family in the shed at Bethlehem which the
kings came to see; but those kings themselves, who
came from such a long way off. He put himself at the
point of view of a holy family less persuaded of its
holiness, who should suddenly see a bevy of grand folks
come up to their door: the miraculous was here. The
spiritual glory was of course on the side of the family
of Joseph; but the temporal glory, the glory that
delighted Gentile, that went to his brain and made him
childishly happy, was with the kings and their retinue.
That retinue&mdash;the trumpeters prancing on white horses,
with gold lace covers, the pages, the armour-bearers,
the treasurers, the huntsmen with the hounds, the
falconers with the hawks, winding for miles down the
hills, and expanding into the circle of strange and
delightful creatures that kings must have about their
persons: jesters with heads thrown back and eyes
squeezed close, while thinking of some funny jest;
dwarfs and negroes, almost as amusing as their camels
and giraffes; tame lynxes chained behind the saddle,
monkeys perched, jabbering, on the horses' manes&mdash;all
this was much more wonderful in Gentile da Fabriano's
opinion than all the wonders of the Church, which
grew somehow less wonderful the more implicitly you
believed in them. Then, in the midst of all these
delightful splendours, the kings themselves! The old
grey-beard in the brown pomegranate embossed brocade
going on all fours, and kissing the little child's feet;
the dark young man, with peaked beard and wistful
face, removing his coroneted turban; and last, but
far from least, the youngest king, the beardless boy,
with the complexion of a well-bred young lady, the
almond eyes and golden hair, standing up in his tunic
of white cloth of silver, while one squire unbuckled his
spurs and another removed his cloak. The darling
little Prince Charming, between whom and the romantic
bearded young king there must for some time have been
considerable rivalry, and alternating views in the minds
of men and the hearts of women (particularly when
the second king, the bearded one, became the John
Pal&aelig;ologus of Benozzo), until it was victoriously borne
in upon the public that this delicate, beardless creature,
so much younger and always the last, must evidently
be <i>the</i> prince, the youngest of the king's sons in the
fairy tales, the one who always succeeds where the two
elder have failed, who gets the Water that Dances and the
Apple Branch that Sings, who carries off the enchanted
oranges, slays the ogre, releases the princess, flies
through the air, the hero, the prince of Fairyland&hellip;.</p>

<p>The fairy business of the story of the Three Kings takes
even greater proportions in the delightful frescoes of
Benozzo Gozzoli in the Riccardi Chapel. Here the
Holy Family are suppressed, so to speak, altogether,
tucked into the altar in a picture, and the act of
adoration at Bethlehem becomes the mere excuse for
the romantic adventures of three people of the highest
quality. The journey itself, where Gentile da Fabriano
sums up in that procession twisting about the background
of his picture, here occupies a whole series of
frescoes. And on this journey is concentrated all that
the Renaissance knew of splendour, delightfulness,
and romance. The green valleys, watered by twisting
streams, with matted grasses, which Botticelli puts
behind his enthroned Madonna and victorious Judith;
Angelico's favourite hillsides with blossoming fruit
trees and pointing cypresses; the mysterious firwoods&mdash;more
mysterious for their remoteness on the high
Apennines&mdash;which fascinate the fancy of Filippo
Lippi; all this is here, and through it all winds the
procession of the Three Kings. There are the splendid
stuffs and Oriental jewels and trappings, the hounds and
monkeys, and jesters and negroes, the falcon on the
wrist, the lynxes chained to the saddle, all the magnificence
dreamed by Gentile da Fabriano; and among it
all ride, met by bevies of peacock-winged angels, kneeling
and singing before the flowering rose-hedges, the
Three Kings. The old man, who looks like some Platonist
philosopher, the beardless prince, surrounded by his
noisy huntsmen and pages; and that dark-bearded
youth in the Byzantine dress and shovel hat, the
genuine king from the East, riding with ardent, wistful
eyes, a beautiful kingly young Quixote: Sir Percival
seeking the Holy Grail, or King Cophetua seeking for
his beggar girl. It is a page of fairy tale, retold by
Boiardo or Spenser.</p>

<p>After such things as these it is difficult to speak of
those more prosaic tales, really intended as such, on
which the painters of the Renaissance spent their
fancy. Still they have all their charm, these fairy
tales, not of the great poets indeed, but of the
nursery.</p>

<p>There is, for instance, the story of a good young man
(with a name for a fairy tale too, &AElig;neas Sylvius
Piccolomini!) showing his adventures by land and sea
and at many courts, the honours conferred on him by
kings and emperors, and how at last he was made
Pope, having begun as a mere poor scholar on a grey
nag; all painted by Pinturicchio in the Cathedral
library of Siena. There is the lamentable story of a
bride and bridegroom, by Vittore Carpaccio: the
stately, tall bride, St. Ursula, and the dear little foolish
bridegroom, looking like her little brother; a story
containing a great many incidents: the sending of an
embassy to the King; the King being sorely puzzled in
his mind, leaning his arm upon his bed and asking the
Queen's advice; the presence upon the palace steps
of an ill-favoured old lady, with a crutch and basket,
suspiciously like the bad fairy who had been forgotten
at the christening; the apparition of an angel to the
Princess, sleeping, with her crown neatly put away at
the foot of the bed; the arrival of the big ship in
foreign parts, with the Bishop and Clergy putting their
heads out of the port-holes and asking very earnestly,
"Where are we?" and finally, a most fearful slaughter
of the Princess and her eleven thousand ladies-in-waiting.
The same Carpaccio&mdash;a regular old gossip
from whom one would expect all the formulas, "and
then he says to the king, Sacred Crown," "and then
the Prince walks, walks, walks, walks." "A company
of knights in armour nice and shining," "three comely
ladies in a green meadow," and so forth of the professional
Italian story-teller&mdash;the same Carpaccio, who was
also, and much more than the more solemn Giovanni
Bellini, the first Venetian to handle oil paints like
Titian and Giorgione, painted the fairy tale of St. George,
with quite the most dreadful dragon's walk, a piece of sea
sand embedded with bones and half-gnawed limbs, and
crawled over by horrid insects, that any one could wish
to see; and quite the most comical dragon, particularly
when led out for execution among the minarets
and cupolas and camels and turbans and symbols of a
kind of small Constantinople.</p>

<p>One of the funniest of all such series of stories, and
which shows that when the Renaissance men were
driven to it they could still invent, though (apparently)
when they had to invent in this fashion, they
ceased to be able to paint, is the tale of Griseldis, attributed
in our National Gallery to Pinturicchio, but
certainly by a very inferior painter of his school. The
Marquis, after hunting deer on a steep little hill, shaded
by elm trees, sees Griseldis going to a well, a pitcher
on her head. He reins in his white horse, and cranes
over in his red cloak, the young parti-coloured lords-in-waiting
pressing forwards to see her, but only as much
as politeness warrants. Scene II.&mdash;A stubbly landscape.
The Marquis, in red and gold cloak and well-combed
yellow head of hair, approaches on foot to the
little pink farm-house. Surprise of old Giannucole,
who is coming down the exterior steps. "Bless my
soul! the Lord Marquis!" "Where is your daughter?"
asks the Marquis, with pointing finger. But the
daughter, hearing voices, has come on to the balcony
and throws up her arms astonished. "Dear me! the
cavalier who accosted me in the wood!" The Marquis
and Grizel walk off, he deferentially dapper, she hanging
back a little in her black smock. Scene III.&mdash;The
Marquis, still in purple and gold, and red stockings and
Hessian boots, says with some timidity and much grace,
pointing to the magnificent clothes brought by his
courtiers, "Would you mind, dear Grizel, putting on
these clothes to please me?" But Griseldis is extremely
modest. She tightens her white shift about
her, and doesn't dare look at the cloth of gold dress
which is so pretty. Scene IV.&mdash;A triumphal arch, with
four gilt figures. The Marquis daintily, with much
wrist-twisting, offers to put the ring on Griseldis' hand,
who obediently accepts, while pages and trumpeters
hold the Marquis's three horses.</p>

<p>Act II. Scene I.&mdash;A portico. Griseldis reluctantly,
but obediently, gives up her baby. Scene II.&mdash;A conspirator
in black cloak and red stockings walks off with
it on the tips of his toes, and then returns and tells the
Marquis that his Magnificence's orders have been executed.
Scene III.&mdash;Giannucole, father of Griseldis,
having been sent for, arrives in his best Sunday cloak.
The Marquis in red, with a crown on, says, standing
hand on hip, "You see, after that I really cannot keep
her on any longer." Several small dogs sniff at each
other in the background. Scene V.&mdash;Triumphal arch,
with bear chained to it, peacock, tame deer, crowd of
courtiers. A lawyer reads the act of divorce. The
Marquis steps forward to Grizel with hands raised,
"After this kind of behaviour, it is quite impossible for
me to live with you any longer." Griseldis is ladylike
and resigned. The Marquis says with acrimonious
politeness, "I am sorry, madam, I must trouble you to
restore to me those garments before departing from
my house." Griseldis slowly let her golden frock fall to
her feet, then walks off (Scene VI.) towards the little
pink farm, where her father is driving the sheep. The
courtiers look on and say, "Dear, dear, what very
strange things do happen!"</p>

<p>Act III. Scene I.&mdash;Outside Giannucole's farm. The
Marquis below. Griseldis at the balcony. He says,
"I want to hire you as a maid." "Yes, my Lord."
Scene II.&mdash;A portico, with a large company at dinner.
The Marquis introduces his supposed bride and brother-in-law,
in reality his own children. He turns round
to Griseldis, who is waiting at table, and bids her be a
little more careful what she is about with those dishes.
Scene III.&mdash;Dumb show. Griseldis, in her black smock,
is sweeping out the future Marchioness's chamber.
Scene IV.&mdash;At table. The Marquis suddenly bids Griseldis,
who is waiting, come and sit by him; he kisses
her, and points at the supposed bride and brother-in-law.
"Those are our children, dear." A young
footman is quite amazed. Scene V.&mdash;A procession of
caparisoned horse, and giraffes carrying monkeys. A
grand supper. "And they live happy ever after."</p>

<p>But the fairy tale, beyond all others, with these
painters of the fifteenth century, is the antique myth.
No Bibbienas and Bembos and Calvos have as yet indoctrinated
them (as Raphael, alas! was indoctrinated)
with the <i>real spirit of classical times</i>, teaching them
that the essence of antiquity was to have no essence at
all; no Ariostos and Tassos have taught the world at
large the real Ovidian conception, the monumental
allegoric nature and tendency to vacant faces and
sprawling, big-toed nudity of the heroes and goddesses
as Giulio Romano and the Caracci so well understood
to paint them. For all the humanists that hung about
courts, the humanities had not penetrated much into
the Italian people. The imaginative form and colour
was still purely medi&aelig;val; and the artists of the
early Renaissance had to work out their Ovidian stories
for themselves, and work them out of their own
material. Hence the mythological creatures of these
early painters are all, more or less, gods in exile, with
that charm of a long residence in the Middle Ages
which makes, for instance, the sweetheart of Ritter
Tannh&auml;user so infinitely more seductive than the
paramour of Adonis; that charm which, when we meet
it occasionally in literature, in parts of Spenser, for
instance, or in a play like Peel's "Arraignment of
Paris," is so peculiarly delightful.</p>

<p>These early painters have made up their Paganism
for themselves, out of all pleasant things they knew;
their fancy has brooded upon it; and the very details
that make us laugh, the details coming direct from the
Middle Ages, the spirit in glaring opposition occasionally
to that of Antiquity, bring home to us how completely
this Pagan fairyland is a genuine reality to
these men. We feel this in nearly all the work of that
sort&mdash;least, in the arch&aelig;ological Mantegna's. We see
it beginning in the mere single figures&mdash;the various
drawings of Orpheus, "Orpheus le doux menestrier
jouant de flutes et de musettes," as Villon called him,
much about that time&mdash;piping or fiddling among little
toy animals out of a Nuremberg box; the drawing of
fauns carrying sheep, some with a queer look of the
Good Shepherd about them, of Pinturicchio; and rising
to such wonderful exhibitions (to me, with their obscure
reminiscence of pageants, they always seem like ballets)
as Perugino's Ceiling of the Cambio, where, among
arabesqued constellations, the gods of antiquity move
gravely along: the bearded knight Mars, armed <i>cap-&agrave;-pie</i>
like a medi&aelig;val warrior; the delicate Mercurius,
a beautiful page-boy stripped of his emblazoned clothes;
Luna dragged along by two nymphs; and Venus daintily
poised on one foot on her dove-drawn chariot, the
exquisite Venus in her clinging veils, conquering the
world with the demure gravity and adorable primness
of a high-born young abbess.</p>

<p>The actual fairy story becomes, little by little, more
complete&mdash;the painters of the fifteenth century work,
little guessing it, are the precursors of Walter Crane.
The full-page illustration of a tale of semi-medi&aelig;val
romance&mdash;of a romance like Spenser's "Fairy Queen"
or Mr. Morris's "Earthly Paradise," exists distinctly
in that picture and drawing, by the young Raphael or
whomsoever else, of Apollo and Marsyas.<a href="#fn9"><sup><small>9</small></sup></a><a name="fn9r" id="fn9r"></a> This piping
Marsyas seated by the tree stump, this naked Apollo,
thin and hectic like an undressed archangel, standing
against the Umbrian valley with its distant blue hills,
its castellated village, its delicate, thinly-leaved trees&mdash;things
we know so well in connection with the Madonna
and Saints, that this seems absent for only a few minutes&mdash;all
this is as little like Ovid as the triumphant antique
Galatea of Raphael is like Spenser. Again, there is
Piero di Cosimo's Death of Procris: the poor young
woman lying dead by the lake, with the little fishing
town in the distance, the swans sailing and cranes
strutting, and the dear young faun&mdash;no Praxitelian god
with invisible ears, still less the obscene beast whom the
late Renaissance copied from Antiquity&mdash;a most gentle,
furry, rustic creature, stooping over her in puzzled,
pathetic concern, at a loss, with his want of the practice
of cities and the knowledge of womankind, what to do
for this poor lady lying among the reeds and the flowering
scarlet sage; a creature the last of whose kind
(friendly, shy, woodland things, half bears or half dogs,
frequent in medi&aelig;val legend), is the satyr of Fletcher's
"Faithful Shepherdess," the only poetic conception in
that gross and insipid piece of magnificent rhetoric.
The perfection of the style must naturally be sought
from Botticelli, and in his Birth of Venus (but who
may speak of that after the writer of most subtle fancy,
of most exquisite language, among living Englishman?)<a href="#fn10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></a><a name="fn10r" id="fn10r"></a>
This goddess, not triumphant but sad in her pale beauty,
a king's daughter bound by some charm to flit on her
shell over the rippling sea, until the winds blow it in
the kingdom of the good fairy Spring, who shelters
her in her laurel grove and covers her nakedness with
the wonderful mantle of fresh-blown flowers&hellip;.</p>

<p>But the imagination born of the love of beautiful and
suggestive detail soars higher; become what I would
call the lyric art of the Renaissance, the art which not
merely gives us beauty, but stirs up in ourselves as
much beauty again of stored-up impression, reaches its
greatest height in certain Venetian pictures of the early
sixteenth century. Pictures of vague or enigmatic subject,
or no subject at all, like Giorgione's F&ecirc;te Champ&ecirc;tre
and Soldier and Gipsy, Titian's Sacred and Profane Love,
The Three Ages of Man, and various smaller pictures
by Bonifazio, Palma, Basaiti; pictures of young men
in velvets and brocades, solemn women with only the
glory of their golden hair and flesh, seated in the grass,
old men looking on pensive, children rolling about;
with the solemnity of great, spreading trees, of greenish
evening skies: the pathos of the song about to begin
or just finished, lute or viol or pipe still lying hard by.
Of such pictures it is best, perhaps, not to speak. The
suggestive imagination is wandering vaguely, dreaming;
fumbling at random sweet, strange chords out of its
viol, like those young men and maidens. The charm
of such works is that they are never explicit; they tell
us, like music, deep secrets, which we feel, but cannot
translate into words.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The first new factor in art which meets us at the
beginning of the sixteenth century is not among the
Italians, and is not a merely artistic power. I speak
of the passionate individual fervour for the newly
recovered Scriptures, manifest among the German engravers,
Protestants all or nearly all, and among whose
works is for ever turning up the sturdy, passionate
face of Luther, the enthusiastic face of Melanchthon.
The very nature of these men's art is conceivable only
where the Bible has suddenly become the reading, and
the chief reading, of the laity. These prints, large and
small, struck off in large numbers, are not church ornaments
like frescoes or pictures, nor aids to monastic
devotion like Angelico's Gospel histories at St. Mark's&mdash;they
are illustrations to the book which every one
is reading, things to be framed in the chamber of
every burgher or mechanic, to be slipped into the
prayer-book of every housewife, to be conned over
during the long afternoons, by the children near the
big stove or among the gooseberry bushes of the
garden. And they are, therefore, much more than the
Giottesque inventions, the expression of the individual
artist's ideas about the incidents of Scripture; and an
expression not for the multitude at large, fresco or
mosaic that could be elaborated by a sceptical or godless
artist, but a re-explanation as from man to man
and friend: this is how the dear Lord looked, or
acted&mdash;see, the words in the Bible are so or so forth.
Therefore, there enters into these designs, which contain
after all only the same sort of skill which was rife
in Italy, so much homeliness at once, and poignancy
and sublimity of imagination. The Virgin, they have
discovered, is not that grandly dressed lady, always in
the very finest brocade, with the very finest manners,
and holding a divine infant that has no earthly wants,
whom Van Eyck and Memling and Meister Stephan
painted. She is a good young woman, a fairer version
of their dear wife, or the woman who might have
been that; no carefully selected creature as with the
Italians, no well-made studio model, with figure unspoilt
by child-bearing, but a real wife and mother,
with real milk in her breasts (the Italian virgin, save
with one or two Lombards, is never permitted to
suckle)<a href="#fn11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></a><a name="fn11r" id="fn11r"></a>, which she very readily and thoroughly gives
to the child, guiding the little mouth with her fingers.
And she sits in the lonely fields by the hedges and
windmills in the fair weather; or in the neat little
chamber with the walled town visible between the
pillar of the window, as in Bartholomew Beham's
exquisite design, reading, or suckling, or sewing, or
soothing the fretful baby; no angels around her, or
rarely: the Scripture says nothing about such a court
of seraphs as the Italians and Flemings, the superstitious
Romanists, always placed round the mother
of Christ. It is all as it might have happened to
them; they translate the Scripture into their everyday
life, they do not pick out of it the mere stately
and poetic incidents like the Giottesques. This everyday
life of theirs is crude enough, and in many cases
nasty enough; they have in those German free towns
a perfect museum of loathsome ugliness, born of ill
ventilation, gluttony, starvation, or brutality: quite
fearful wrinkled harridans and unabashed fat, guzzling
harlots, and men of every variety of scrofula, and wart
and belly, towards none of which (the best far transcending
the worst Italian Judas) they seem to feel
any repugnance. They have also a beastly love of
horrors; their decollations and flagellations are quite
sickening in detail, as distinguished from the tidy,
decorous executions of the early Italians; and one
feels that they do enjoy seeing, as in one of their
prints, the bowels of St. Erasmus being taken out with
a windlass, or Jael, as Altdorfer has shown her in his
romantic print, neatly hammering the nail into the
head of the sprawling, snoring Sisera. There is a
good deal of grossness, too (of which, among the
Italians, even Robetta and similar, there is so little),
in the details of village fairs and adventures of wenches
with their Schatz; and a strange permeating nightmare,
gruesomeness of lewd, warty devils, made up of
snouts, hoofs, bills, claws, and incoherent parts of incoherent
creatures; of perpetual skeletons climbing in
trees, or appearing behind flower-beds. But there is
also&mdash;and Holbein's Dance of Death, terrible, jocular,
tender, vulgar and poetic, contains it all, this German
world&mdash;a great tenderness. Tenderness not merely in
the heads of women and children, in the fervent embrace
of husband and wife and mother and daughter; but in
the feeling for dumb creatures and inanimate things, the
gentle dogs of St. Hubert, the deer that crouch among
the rocks with Genevieve, the very tangled grasses
and larches and gentians that hang to the crags,
drawn as no Italian ever drew them; the quiet, sentimental
little landscapes of castles on fir-clad hills, of
manor-houses, gabled and chimneyed, among the reeds
and willows of shallow ponds. These feelings, Teutonic
doubtless, but less medi&aelig;val than we might think,
for the Middle Ages of the Minnesingers were terribly
conventional, seem to well up at the voice of Luther;
and it is this which make the German engravers,
men not always of the highest talents, invent new
and beautiful Gospel pictures. Of these I would
take two as typical&mdash;typical of individual fancy most
strangely contrasting with the conventionalism of the
Italians. Let the reader think of any of the scores
of Flights into Egypt, and of Resurrections by fifteenth-century
Italians, or even Giottesques; and then turn
to two prints, one of each of these subjects respectively,
by Martin Schongauer and Altdorfer. Schongauer gives
a delightful oasis: palms and prickly pears, the latter
conceived as growing at the top of a tree; below,
lizards at play and deer grazing; in this place the
Virgin has drawn up her ass, who browses the thistles
at his feet, while St. Joseph, his pilgrim bottle bobbing
on his back, hangs himself with all his weight to the
branches of a date palm, trying to get the fruit within
reach. Meanwhile a bevy of sweet little angels have
come to the rescue; they sit among the branches,
dragging them down towards him, and even bending
the whole stem at the top so that he may get at the
dates. Such a thing as this is quite lovely, particularly
after the routine of St. Joseph trudging along after the
donkey, the eternal theme of the Italians. In Altdorfer's
print Christ is ascending in a glory of sunrise
clouds, banner in hand, angels and cherubs peering
with shy curiosity round the cloud edge. The sepulchre
is open, guards asleep or stretching themselves, and
yawning all round; and childish young angels look
reverently into the empty grave, rearranging the cerecloths,
and trying to roll back the stone lid. One of
them leans forward, and utterly dazzles a negro watchman,
stepping forward, lantern in hand; in the distance
shepherds are seen prowling about. "This," says
Altdorfer to himself, "is how it must have happened."</p>

<p>Hence, among these Germans, the dreadful seriousness
and pathos of the Passion, the violence of the mob,
the brutality of the executioners, above all, the awful
sadness of Christ. There is here somewhat of the
realisation of what He must have felt in finding the
world He had come to redeem so vile and cruel. In
what way, under what circumstances, such thoughts
would come to these men, is revealed to us by that
magnificent head of the suffering Saviour&mdash;a design
apparently for a carved crucifix&mdash;under which Albrecht
D&uuml;rer wrote the pathetic words: "I drew this in my
sickness."</p>

<p>Thus much of the power of that new factor, the
individual interest in the Scriptures. All other innovations
on the treatment of religious themes were due,
in the sixteenth century, but still more in the seventeenth,
to the development of some new artistic
possibility, or to the gathering together in the hands of
one man of artistic powers hitherto existing only in a
dispersed condition. This is the secret of the greatness
of Raphael as a pictorial poet, that he could do all
manner of new things merely by holding all the old
means in his grasp. This is the secret of those wonderful
inventions of his, which do not take our breath
away like Michelangelo's or Rembrandt's, but seem
at the moment the one and only right rendering of
the subject: the Liberation of St. Peter, Heliodorus,
Ezechiel, and the whole series of magnificent Old
Testament stories on the ceiling of the Loggie. In
Raphael we see the perfect fulfilment of the Giottesque
programme: he can do all that the first theme inventors
required for the carrying out of their ideas; and
therefore he can have new, entirely new, themes.
Raphael furnishes, for the first time since Giotto, an
almost complete set of pictorial interpretations of
Scripture.</p>

<p>We are now, as we proceed in the sixteenth century,
in the region where new artistic powers admit of new
imaginative conceptions on the part of the individual.
We gain immensely by the liberation from the old
tradition, but we lose immensely also. We get the
benefit of the fancy and feelings of this individual, but
we are at the mercy, also, of his stupidity and vulgarity.
Of this the great examples are Tintoretto, and after
him Velasquez and Rembrandt. Of Tintoret I would
speak later, for he is eminently the artist in whom the
gain and the loss are most typified, and perhaps most
equally distributed, and because, therefore, he contrasts
best with the masters anterior to Raphael.</p>

<p>The new powers in Velasquez and Rembrandt were
connected with the problem of light, or rather, one
might say, in the second case, of darkness. This new
faculty of seizing the beauties, momentary and not
inherent in the object, due to the various effects of
atmosphere and lighting up, added probably a good third
to the pleasure-bestowing faculty of art; it was the
beginning of a kind of democratic movement against
the stern domination of such things as were privileged
in shape and colour. A thousand things, ugly or unimaginative
in themselves, a plain face, a sallow complexion,
an awkward gesture, a dull arrangement of
lines, could be made delightful and suggestive. A wet
yard, a pail and mop, and a servant washing fish under
a pump could become, in the hands of Peter de Hoogh,
and thanks to the magic of light and shade, as beautiful
and interesting in their way as a swirl of angels and
lilies by Botticelli. But this redemption of the vulgar
was at the expense, as I have elsewhere pointed out, of
a certain growing callousness to vulgarity. What holds
good as to the actual artistic, visible quality, holds good
also as to the imaginative value. Velasquez's Flagellation,
if indeed it be his, in our National Gallery, has
a pathos, a something that catches you by the throat,
in that melancholy weary body, broken with ignominy
and pain, sinking down by the side of the column,
which is inseparable from the dreary grey light, the
livid colour of the flesh&mdash;there is no joy in the world
where such things can be. But the angel who has
just entered has not come from heaven&mdash;such a creature
is fit only to roughly shake up the pillows of
paupers, dying in the damp dawn in the hospital
wards.</p>

<p>It is, in a measure, different with Rembrandt, exactly
because he is the master, not of light, but of darkness,
or of light that utterly dazzles. His ugly women and
dirty Jews of Rotterdam are either hidden in the gloom
or reduced to mere vague outlines, specks like gnats in
the sunshine, in the effulgence of light. Hence we can
enjoy, almost without any disturbing impressions, the
marvellous imagination shown in his etchings of Bible
stories. Rembrandt is to D&uuml;rer as an archangel to a
saint: where the German draws, the Dutchman seems
to bite his etching plate with elemental darkness and
glory. Of these etchings I would mention a few; the
reader may put these indications alongside of his
remembrances of the Arena Chapel, or of Angelico's
cupboard panels in the Academy at Florence: they
show how intimately dramatic imagination depends in
art upon mere technical means, how hopelessly limited
to mere indication were the early artists, how forced
along the path of dramatic realisation are the men of
modern times.</p>

<p><i>The Annunciation to the Shepherds</i>: The heavens open
in a circular whirl among the storm darkness, cherubs
whirling distantly like innumerable motes in a sunbeam;
the angel steps forward on a ray of light, projecting
into the ink-black night. The herds have
perceived the vision, and rush headlong in all directions,
while the trees groan beneath the blast of that
opening of heaven. A horse, seen in profile, with the
light striking on his eyeball, seems paralysed by terror.
The shepherds have only just awakened. <i>The Nativity</i>:
Darkness. A vague crowd of country folk jostling each
other noiselessly. A lantern, a white speck in the
centre, sheds a smoky, uncertain light on the corner
where the Child sleeps upon the pillows, the Virgin,
wearied, resting by its side, her face on her hand.
Joseph is seated by, only his head visible above his
book. The cows are just visible in the gloom. The
lantern is held by a man coming carefully forward,
uncovering his head, the crowd behind him. <i>A Halt
on the Journey to Egypt</i>: Night. The lantern hung on
a branch. Joseph seated sleepily, with his fur cap
drawn down; the Virgin and Child resting against the
packsaddle on the ground. <i>An Interior</i>: The Virgin
hugging and rocking the Child. Joseph, outside, looks
in through the window. <i>The Raising of Lazarus</i>: A
vault hung with scimitars, turbans, and quivers.
Against the brilliant daylight just let in, the figure of
Christ, seen from behind, stands out in His long robes,
raising His hand to bid the dead arise. Lazarus, pale,
ghost-like in this effulgence, slowly, wearily raises his
head in the sepulchre. The crowd falls back. Astonishment,
awe. This coarse Dutchman has suppressed
the incident of the bystanders holding their nose, to
which the Giottesques clung desperately. This is not
a moment to think of stenches or infection. <i>Entombment</i>:
Night. The platform below the cross. A bier,
empty, spread with a winding-sheet, an old man arranging
it at the head. The dead Saviour being slipped down
from the cross on a sheet, two men on a ladder letting
the body down, others below receiving it, trying to
prevent the arm from trailing. Immense solemnity,
carefulness, hushedness. A distant illuminated palace
blazes out in the night. One feels that they are stealing
Him away.</p>

<p>I have reversed the chronological order and chosen
to speak of Tintoret after Rembrandt, because, being an
Italian and still in contact with some of the old tradition,
the great Venetian can show more completely,
both what was gained and what was lost in imaginative
rendering by the liberation of the individual artist and
the development of artistic means. First, of the gain.
This depends mainly upon Tintoret's handling of light
and shade, and his foreshortenings: it enables him to
compose entirely in huge masses, to divide or concentrate
the interest, to throw into vague insignificance
the less important parts of a situation in order to insist
upon the more important; it gives him the power also
of impressing us by the colossal and the ominous. The
masterpiece of this style, and probably Tintoret's masterpiece
therefore, is the great Crucifixion at S. Rocco.
To feel its full tragic splendour one must think of the
finest things which the early Renaissance achieved,
such as Luini's beautiful fresco at Lugano; by the side
of the painting at S. Rocco everything is tame, except,
perhaps, Rembrandt's etching called the Three Crosses.
After this, and especially to be compared with the
frescoes of Masaccio and Ghirlandaio of the same subject,
comes the Baptism of Christ. The old details of
figures dressing and undressing, which gave so much
pleasure to earlier painters, for instance, Piero della
Francesca, in the National Gallery, are entirely omitted,
as the nose-holding in the Raising of Lazarus, is omitted
by Rembrandt. Christ kneels in the Jordan, with
John bending over him, and vague multitudes crowding
the banks, distant, dreamlike beneath the yellow storm-light.
Of Tintoret's Christ before Pilate, of that figure
of the Saviour, long, straight, wrapped in white and
luminous like his own wraith, I have spoken already.
But I must speak of the S. Rocco Christ in the Garden,
as imaginative as anything by Rembrandt, and infinitely
more beautiful. The moonlight tips the draperies
of the three sleeping apostles, gigantic, solemn.
Above, among the bushes, leaning His head on His hand,
is seated Christ, weary to death, numbed by grief and
isolation, recruiting for final resistance. The sense of
being abandoned of all men and of God has never been
brought home in this way by any other painter; the
little tear-stained Saviours, praying in broad daylight,
of Perugino and his fellows, are mere distressed mortals.
This betrayed and resigned Saviour has upon Him the
<i>weltschmerz</i> of Prometheus. But even here we begin
to feel the loss, as well as the gain, of the painter
being forced from the dramatic routine of earlier days:
instead of the sweet, tearful little angel of the early
Renaissance, there comes to this tragic Christ, in a
blood-red nimbus, a brutal winged creature thrusting
the cup in His face. The uncertainty of Tintoret's
inspirations, the uncertainty of result of these astonishing
pictorial methods of attaining the dramatic, the
occasional vapidness and vulgarity of the man, unrestrained
by any stately tradition like the vapidness
and vulgarity of so many earlier masters,<a href="#fn12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></a><a name="fn12r" id="fn12r"></a> comes out
already at S. Rocco. And principally in the scene of
the Temptation, a theme rarely, if ever, treated before
the sixteenth century, and which Tintoret has made
unspeakably mean in its unclean and dramatically
impotent suggestiveness: the Saviour parleying from
a kind of rustic edifice with a good-humoured, fat,
half feminine Satan, fluttering with pink wings like
some smug seraph of Bernini's pupils. After this it is
scarce necessary to speak of whatever is dramatically
abortive (because successfully expressing just the wrong
sort of sentiment, the wrong situation) in Tintoret's
work: his Woman taken in Adultery, with the dapper
young Rabbi, offended neither by adultery in general
nor by this adulteress in particular; the Washing of
the Feet, in London, where the conversation appears to
turn upon the excessive hotness or coldness of the
water in the tub; the Last Supper at S. Giorgio Maggiore,
where, among the mysterious wreaths of smoke
peopled with angels, Christ rises from His seat and
holds the cup to His neighbour's lips with the gesture,
as He says, "This is My blood," of a conjuror to an
incredulous and indifferent audience. To Tintoret the
contents of the chalice is the all-important matter:
where is the majesty of the old Giottesque gesture,
preserved by Leonardo, of pushing forward the bread
with one hand, the wine with the other, and thus uncovering
the head and breast of the Saviour, the gesture
which does indeed mean&mdash;"I am the bread you shall
eat, and the wine you shall drink"? There remains,
however, to mention another work of Tintoret's which,
coming in contact with one's recollections of earlier
art, may suggest strange doubts and well nigh shake
one's faith in the imaginative efficacy of all that went
before: his enormous canvas of the Last Day, at S.
Maria dell' Orto. The first and overwhelming impression,
even before one has had time to look into this
apocalyptic work, is that no one could have conceived
such a thing in earlier days, not even Michelangelo
when he painted his Last Judgment, nor Raphael when
he designed the Vision of Ezechiel. This is, indeed,
one thinks, a revelation of the end of all things. Great
storm clouds, whereon throne the Almighty and His
Elect, brood over the world, across which, among the
crevassed, upheaving earth, pours the wide glacier
torrent of Styx, with the boat of Charon struggling
across its precipitous waters. The angels, confused with
the storm clouds of which they are the spirit, lash the
damned down to the Hell stream, band upon band,
even from the far distance. And in the foreground
the rocks are splitting, the soil is upheaving with the
dead beneath; here protrudes a huge arm, there a
skull; in one place the clay, rising, has assumed the
vague outline of the face below. In the rocks and
water, among the clutching, gigantic men, the huge,
full-bosomed woman, tosses a frightful half-fleshed
carcass, grass still growing from his finger tips, his
grinning skull, covered half with hair and half with
weeds, greenish and mouldering: a sinner still green
in earth and already arising.</p>

<p>A wonderful picture: a marvellous imaginative mind,
with marvellous imaginative means at his command.
Yet, let us ask ourselves, what is the value of the
result? A magnificent display of attitudes and forms,
a sort of bravura ghastliness and impressiveness, which
are in a sense <i>barrocco</i>, reminding us of the wax plague
models of Florence and of certain poems of Baudelaire's.
But of the feeling, the poetry of this greatest
of all scenes, what is there? And, standing before it,
I think instinctively of that chapel far off on the windswept
Umbrian rock, with Signorelli's Resurrection:
a flat wall accepted as a flat wall, no place, nowhere.
A half-dozen groups, not closely combined. Colour
reduced to monochrome; light and shade nowhere, as
nowhere also all these devices of perspective. But in
that simply treated fresco, with its arrangement as
simple as that of a vast antique bas-relief, there is an
imaginative suggestion far surpassing this of Tintoret's.
The breathless effort of the youths breaking through
the earth's crust, shaking their long hair and gasping;
the stagger of those rising to their feet; the stolidity,
hand on hip, of those who have recovered their body
but not their mind, blinded by the light, deafened by
the trumpets of Judgment; the absolute self-abandonment
of those who can raise themselves no higher;
the dull, awe-stricken look of those who have found
their companions, clasping each other in vague, weak
wonder; and further, under the two archangels who
stoop downwards with the pennons of their trumpets
streaming in the blast, those figures who beckon to the
re-found beloved ones, or who shade their eyes and
point to a glory on the horizon, or who, having striven
forward, sink on their knees, overcome by a vision
which they alone can behold. And recollecting that
fresco of Signorelli's, you feel as if this vast, tall canvas
at S. Maria dell' Orto, where topple and welter the
dead and the quick, were merely so much rhetorical
rhodomontade by the side of the old hymn of the Last
Day&mdash;</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Again, in the chaos of newly-developing artistic means,
and of struggling individual imaginations, we get once
more, at the end of the eighteenth century, to what we
found at the beginning of the fourteenth: the art that
does not show, but merely speaks. We find it in what,
of all things, are the apparently most different to the
quiet and placid outline illustration of the Giottesque:
in the terrible portfolio of Goya's etchings, called the
Disasters of War. Like D&uuml;rer and Rembrandt, the
great Spaniard is at once extremely realistic and extremely
imaginative. But his realism means fidelity,
not to the real aspect of things, of the <i>thing in itself</i>,
so to speak, but to the way in which things will appear
to the spectator at a given moment. He isolates what
you might call a case, separating it from the multitude
of similar cases, giving you one execution where several
must be going on, one firing off of cannon, one or two
figures in a burning or a massacre; and his technique
conduces thereunto, blurring a lot, rendering only the
outline and gesture, and that outline and gesture frequently
so momentary as to be confused. But he is
real beyond words in his reproduction of the way in
which such dreadful things must stamp themselves
upon the mind. They are isolated, concentrated, distorted:
the multiplicity of horrors making the perceiving
mind more sensitive, morbid as from opium eating, and
thus making the single impression, which excludes all
the rest, more vivid and tremendous than, without that
unconsciously perceived rest, it could possibly be. Nay,
more, these scenes are not merely rather such as they
were recollected than as they really were seen; they are
such as they were recollected in the minds and feelings
of peasants and soldiers, of people who could not free
their attention to arrange all these matters logically,
to give them their relative logical value. The slaughtering
soldiers&mdash;Spaniards, English, or French&mdash;of the
Napoleonic period become in his plates Turks, Saracens,
huge vague things in half Oriental costumes, whiskered,
almost turbaned in their fur caps, they become almost
ogres, even as they must have done in the popular
mind. The shooting of deserters and prisoners is reduced
to the figures at the stake, the six carbine muzzles
facing them: no shooting soldiers, no stocks to the
carbines, any more than in the feeling of the man who
was being shot. The artistic training, the habit of
deliberately or unconsciously looking for visible effects
which all educated moderns possess, prevents even our
writers from thus reproducing what has been the actual
mental reality. But Goya does not for a moment let
us suspect the presence of the artist, the quasi-writer.
The impression reproduced is the impression, not of the
artistic bystander, but of the sufferer or the sufferer's
comrades. This makes him extraordinarily faithful to
the epigraphs of his plates. We feel that the woman,
all alone, without bystanders, earthworks, fascines,
smoke, &amp;c., firing off the cannon, is the woman as she is
remembered by the creature who exclaims, "Que valor!"
We feel that the half-dead soldier being stripped, the
condemned turning his head aside as far as the rope
will permit, the man fallen crushed beneath his horse
or vomiting out his blood, is the wretch who exclaims,
"Por eso soy nacido!" They are, these etchings of
Goya's, the representation of the sufferings, real and
imaginative, of the real sufferers. In the most absolute
sense they are the art which does not merely show, but
tells; the suggestive and dramatic art of the individual,
unaided and unhampered by tradition, indifferent to
form and technicality, the art which even like the art
of the immediate predecessors of Giotto, those Giuntas
and Berlinghieris, who left us the hideous and terrible
Crucifixions, says to the world, "You shall understand
and feel."</p>

<h3><a name="TUSCAN_SCULPTURE" id="TUSCAN_SCULPTURE"></a>TUSCAN SCULPTURE</h3>
<h3>I</h3>

<p>We are all of us familiar with the two adjacent rooms
at South Kensington which contain, respectively, the
casts from antique sculpture and those from the sculpture
of the Renaissance; and we are familiar also with
the sense of irritation or of relief which accompanies
our passing from one of them to the other. This feeling
is typical of our frame of mind towards various
branches of the same art, and, indeed, towards all
things which might be alike, but happen to be unlike.
Times, countries, nations, temperaments, ideas, and
tendencies, all benefit and suffer alternately by our
habit of considering that if two things of one sort
are not identical, one must be in the right and the
other in the wrong. The act of comparison evokes at
once our innate tendency to find fault; and having
found fault, we rarely perceive that, on better comparing,
there may be no fault at all to find.</p>

<p>As the result of such comparison, we shall find that
Renaissance sculpture is unrestful, huddled, lacking
selection of form and harmony of proportions; it reproduces
ugliness and perpetuates effort; it is sometimes
grotesque, and frequently vulgar. Or again, that
antique sculpture is conventional, insipid, monotonous,
without perception for the charm of detail or the interest
of individuality; afraid of movement and expression,
and at the same time indifferent to outline
and grouping; giving us florid nudities which never
were alive, and which are doing and thinking nothing
whatever. Thus, according to which room or which
mood we enter first, we are sure to experience either
irritation at wrong-headedness or relief at right-doing;
whether we pass from the sculpture of ancient
Greece to the sculpture of medi&aelig;val Italy, or <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>.</p>

<p>But a more patient comparison of these two branches
of sculpture, and of the circumstances which made
each what it was, will enable us to enjoy the very
different merits of both, and will teach us also something
of the vital processes of the particular spiritual
organism which we call an art.</p>

<p>In the early phase of the philosophy of art&mdash;a phase
lingering on to our own day in the works of certain
critics&mdash;the peculiarities of a work of art were explained
by the peculiarities of character of the artist:
the paintings of Raphael and the music of Mozart partook
of the gentleness of their life; while the figures
of Michelangelo and the compositions of Beethoven
were the outcome of their misanthropic ruggedness of
temper. The insufficiency, often the falseness, of such
explanations became evident when critics began to
perceive that the works of one time and country usually
possessed certain common peculiarities which did not
correspond to any resemblance between the characters
of their respective artists; peculiarities so much
more dominant than any others, that a statue or a picture
which was unsigned and of obscure history was
constantly attributed to half-a-dozen contemporary
sculptors or painters by half-a-dozen equally learned
critics. The recognition of this fact led to the substitution
of the <i>environment</i> (the <i>milieu</i> of Monsieur Taine)
as an explanation of the characteristics, no longer of a
single work of art, but of a school or group of kindred
works. Greek art henceforth was the serene outcome
of a serene civilisation of athletes, poets, and philosophers,
living with untroubled consciences in a good
climate, with slaves and helots to char for them while
they ran races, discussed elevated topics, and took part
in Panathenaic processions, riding half naked on prancing
horses, or carrying olive branches and sacrificial
vases in honour of a divine patron, in whom they
believed only as much as they liked. And the art of
the Middle Ages was the fantastic, far-fetched, and
often morbid production of nations of crusaders and
theologians, burning heretics, worshipping ladies, seeing
visions, and periodically joining hands in a vertiginous
death-reel, whose figures were danced from country
to country. This new explanation, while undoubtedly
less misleading than the other one, had the disadvantage
of straining the characteristics of a civilisation
or of an art in order to tally with its product or
producer; it forgot that Antiquity was not wholly
represented by the frieze of the Parthenon, and that
the Gothic cathedrals and the frescoes of Giotto had
characteristics more conspicuous than morbidness and
insanity.</p>

<p>Moreover, in the same way that the old personal
criticism was unable to account for the resemblance
between the works of different individuals of the same
school, so the theory of the environment fails to explain
certain qualities possessed in common by various schools
of art and various arts which have arisen under the
pressure of different civilisations; and it is obliged
to slur over the fact that the sculpture of the time
of Pericles and Alexander, the painting of the early
sixteenth century, and the music of the age of Handel,
Haydn, and Mozart are all very much more like one
another in their serene beauty than they are any of
them like the other productions, artistic or human,
of their environment. Behind this explanation there
must therefore be another, not controverting the portion
of truth it contains, but completing it by the
recognition of a relation more intimate than that of
the work of art with its environment: the relation
of form and material. The perceptions of the artist,
what he sees and how he sees it, can be transmitted to
others only through processes as various as themselves:
hair seen as colour is best imitated with paint, hair
seen as form with twisted metal wire. It is as impossible
to embody certain perceptions in some stages
of handicraft as it would be to construct a complex
machine in a rudimentary condition of mechanics.
Certain modes of vision require certain methods of
painting, and these require certain kinds of surface
and pigment. Until these exist, a man may see correctly,
but he cannot reproduce what he is seeing.
In short, the work of art represents the meeting of
a mode of seeing and feeling (determined partly by
individual characteristics, partly by those of the age
and country) and of a mode of treating materials, a
craft which may itself be, like the mind of the artist,
in a higher or lower stage of development.</p>

<p>The early Greeks had little occasion to become
skilful carvers of stone. Their buildings, which reproduced
a very simple wooden structure, were ornamented
with little more than the imitation of the original
carpentering; for the Ionic order, poor as it is of
ornament, came only later; and the Corinthian, which
alone offered scope for variety and skill of carving,
arose only when figure sculpture was mature. But the
Greeks, being only just in the iron period (and iron,
by the way, is the tool for stone), were great moulders
of clay and casters of metal. The things which later
ages made of iron, stone, or wood, they made of clay or
bronze. The thousands of exquisite utensils, weapons,
and toys in our museums make this apparent; from
the bronze greaves delicately modelled like the legs
they were to cover, to the earthenware dolls, little
Venuses, exquisitely dainty, with articulated legs and
go-carts.</p>

<p>Hence the human figure came to be imitated by a
process which was not sculpture in the literal sense of
carving. It is significant that the Latin word whence
we get <i>effigy</i> has also given us <i>fictile</i>, the making of
statues being thus connected with the making of pots;
and that the whole vocabulary of ancient authors
shows that they thought of statuary not as akin to
cutting and chiselling, but to moulding (&#960;&#955;&#940;&#963;&#963;&#969; &#61;
<i>fingo</i>), shaping out of clay on the wheel or with the
modelling tool.<a href="#fn13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></a><a name="fn13r" id="fn13r"></a> It seems probable that marble-work
was but rarely used for the round until the sixth century;
and the treatment of the hair, the propping of
projecting limbs and drapery, makes it obvious that a
large proportion of the antiques in our possession are
marble copies of long-destroyed bronzes.<a href="#fn14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></a><a name="fn14r" id="fn14r"></a> So that the
Greek statue, even if eventually destined for marble,
was conceived by a man having the habit of modelling
in clay.</p>

<p>Let us turn from early Greece to medi&aelig;val Italy.
Hammered iron had superseded bronze for weapons
and armour, and silver and gold, worked with the
chisel, for ornaments. On the other hand, the introduction
from the East of glazed pottery had banished
to the art of the glass-blower all fancy in shaping
utensils. There was no demand in common life for
cast metal-work, and there being no demand for
casting, there was no practice either in its cognate
preliminary art of moulding clay. Hence, such bronze
work as originated was very unsatisfactory; the lack
of skill in casting, and the consequent elaboration of
bronze-work with the file, lasting late into the Renaissance.
But the men of the Middle Ages were
marvellously skilful carvers of stone. Architecture,
ever since the Roman time, had given more and more
importance to sculptured ornament: already exquisite
in the early Byzantine screens and capitals, it developed
through the elaborate mouldings, traceries, and
columns of the Lombard style into the art of elaborate
reliefs and groups of the full-blown Gothic;
indeed the Gothic church is, in Italy, the work no
longer of the mason, but of the sculptor. It is no
empty coincidence that the hillside villages which still
supply Florence with stone and with stonemasons
should have given their names to three of its greatest
sculptors, Mino da Fiesole, Desiderio da Settignano,
and Benedetto da Maiano; that Michelangelo should
have told Vasari that the chisel and mallet had come
to him with the milk of his nurse, a stonecutter's wife
from those same slopes, down which jingle to-day the
mules carting ready-shaped stone from the quarries.
The medi&aelig;val Tuscans, the Pisans of the thirteenth, and
the Florentines of the fifteenth century, evidently made
small wax or clay sketches of their statues; but their
works are conceived and executed in the marble, and
their art has come out of the stone without interposition
of other material, even as the figures which
Michelangelo chopped, living and colossal, direct out
of the block.<a href="#fn15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></a><a name="fn15r" id="fn15r"></a></p>

<p>The Greek, therefore, was a moulder of clay, a caster
of bronze, in the early time when the art acquires its
character and takes its direction; in that period, on
the contrary, the Tuscan was a chaser of silver, a hammerer
of iron, above all a cutter of stone. Now clay
(and we must remember that bronze is originally clay)
means the modelled plane and succession of planes
smoothed and rounded by the finger, the imitation of
all nature's gently graduated swellings and depressions,
the absolute form as it exists to the touch; but clay
does not give interesting light and shade, and bronze is
positively blurred by high lights; and neither clay nor
bronze has any resemblance to the texture of human
limbs or drapery: it gives the form, but not the stuff.
It is the exact reverse with marble. Granulated like
a living fibre, yet susceptible of a delicate polish, it can
imitate the actual substance of human flesh, with its
alternations of opacity and luminousness; it can reproduce,
beneath the varied strokes of the chisel, the
grain, running now one way, now another, which is
given to the porous skin by the close-packed bone and
muscle below. Moreover, it is so docile, so soft, yet so
resistant, that the iron can cut it like butter or engrave
it lightly like agate; so that the shadows may pour
deep into chasms and pools, or run over the surface in a
network of shallow threads; light and shade becoming
the artist's material as much as the stone itself.</p>

<p>The Greek, as a result, perceived form not as an
appearance, but as a reality; saw with the eye the
complexities of projection and depression perceivable
by the hand. His craft was that of measurements, of
minute proportion, of delicate concave and convex&mdash;in
one word, of <i>planes</i>. His dull, malleable clay, and
ductile, shining bronze had taught him nothing of the
way in which light and shadow corrode, blur, and
pattern a surface. His fancy, his skill, embraced the
human form like the gypsum of the moulder, received
the stamp of its absolute being. The beauty he sought
was concrete, actual, the same in all lights and from
all points of view: the comely man himself, not the
beautiful marble picture.</p>

<p>The marble picture, on the other hand&mdash;a picture
in however high and complete relief&mdash;a picture for a
definite point of view, arranged by receiving light projected
at a given angle on a surface cut deep or shallow
especially to receive it&mdash;was produced by the sculpture
that spontaneously grew out of the architectural stone-cutting
of the Byzantine and Lombard schools. The
mouldings on a church, still more the stone ornaments
of its capitals, pulpit, and choir rails, seen, as they are,
each at various and peculiar heights above the eye,
under light which, however varying, can never get
behind or above them if outdoor, below or in flank if
indoor&mdash;these mouldings, part of a great architectural
pattern of black and white, inevitably taught the
masons all the subtle play of light and surface, all the
deceits of position and perspective. And the mere
manipulation of the marble taught them, as we have
seen, the exquisite finenesses of surface, texture, crease,
accent, and line. What the figure actually was&mdash;the
real proportions and planes, the actual form of the
model&mdash;did not matter; no hand was to touch it, no
eye to measure; it was to be delightful only in the
position which the artist chose, and in no other had it
a right to be seen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II</p>

<p>These were the two arts, originating from a material
and a habit of work which were entirely different, and
which produced artistic necessities diametrically opposed.
It might be curious to speculate upon what
would have resulted had their position in history been
reversed; what statues we should possess had the
marble-carving art born of architectural decoration
originated in Greece, and the art of clay and bronze
flourished in Christian and medi&aelig;val Italy. Be this
as it may, the accident of the surroundings&mdash;of the
habits of life and thought which pressed on the artist,
and combined with the necessities of his material
method&mdash;appears to have intensified the peculiarities
organic in each of the two sculptures. I say <i>appears</i>,
because we must bear in mind that the combination
was merely fortuitous, and guard against the habit of
thinking that because a type is familiar it is therefore
alone conceivable.</p>

<p>We all know all about the antique and the medi&aelig;val
<i>milieu</i>. It is useless to recapitulate the influence, on
the one hand, of antique civilisation, with its southern
outdoor existence, its high training of the body, its
draped citizens, naked athletes, and half-clothed work-folk,
its sensuous religion of earthly gods and muscular
demigods; or the influence, on the other hand, of the
more complex life of the Middle Ages, essentially northern
in type, sedentary and manufacturing, huddled
in unventilated towns, with its constant pre-occupation,
even among the most sordid grossness, of the
splendour of the soul, the beauty of suffering, the
ignominy of the body, and the dangers of bodily
prosperity. Of all this we have heard even too
much, thanks to the picturesqueness which has recommended
the <i>milieu</i> of Monsieur Taine to writers
more mindful of literary effect than of the philosophy
of art. But there is another historical circumstance
whose influence, in differentiating Greek sculpture
from the sculpture of medi&aelig;val Italy, can scarcely
be overrated. It is that, whereas in ancient Greece
sculpture was the important, fully developed art,
and painting merely its shadow; in medi&aelig;val Italy
painting was the art which best answered the requirements
of the civilisation, the art struggling with
the most important problems; and that painting therefore
reacted strongly upon sculpture. Greek painting
was the shadow of Greek sculpture in an almost
literal sense: the figures on wall and base, carefully
modelled, without texture, symmetrically arranged
alongside of each other regardless of pictorial pattern,
seem indeed to be projected on to the flat surface by
the statues; they are, most certainly, the shadow of
modelled figures cast on the painter's mind.</p>

<p>The sculptor could learn nothing new from paintings
where all that is proper to painting is ignored:&mdash;plane
always preferred to line, the constructive details, perceptible
only as projection, not as colour or value (like
the insertion of the leg and the thigh), marked by deep
lines that look like tattoo marks; and perspective
almost entirely ignored, at least till a late period. It
is necessary thus to examine Greek painting<a href="#fn16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></a><a name="fn16r" id="fn16r"></a> in order
to appreciate, by comparison with this negative art, the
very positive influence of medi&aelig;val painting or medi&aelig;val
sculpture. The painting on a flat surface&mdash;fresco or
panel&mdash;which became more and more the chief artistic
expression of those times, taught men to consider
perspective; and, with perspective and its possibility
of figures on many planes, grouping: the pattern that
must arise from juxtaposed limbs and heads. It
taught them to perceive form no longer as projection
or plane; but as line and light and shade, as something
whose charm lay mainly in the boundary curves,
the silhouette, so much more important in one single,
unchangeable position than where, the eye wandering
round a statue, the only moderate interest of one
point of view is compensated by the additional interest
of another. Moreover, painting, itself the product of
a much greater interest in colour than Antiquity had
known, forced upon men's attention the important
influence of colour upon form. For, although the
human being, if we abstract the element of colour,
if we do it over with white paint, has indeed the
broad, somewhat vague form, the indecision of lines
which characterises antique sculpture; yet the human
being as he really exists, with his coloured hair, eyes,
and lips, his cheeks, forehead, and chin patterned
with tint, has a much greater sharpness, precision,
contrast of form, due to the additional emphasis of
the colour. Hence, as pictorial perspective and composition
undoubtedly inclined sculptors to seek greater
complexities of relief and greater unity of point of
view, so the new importance of drawing and colouring
suggested to them a new view of form. A human
being was no longer a mere arrangement of planes
and of masses, homogeneous in texture and colour.
He was made of different substances, of hair, skin
over fat, muscle, or bone, skin smooth, wrinkled, or
stubbly, and, besides this, he was painted different
colours. He had, moreover, what the Greeks had
calmly whitewashed away, or replaced by an immovable
jewel or enamel: that extraordinary and
extraordinarily various thing called an Eye.</p>

<p>All these differences between the monochrome creature&mdash;colour
abstracted&mdash;of the Greeks and the mottled
real human being, the sculptors of the Renaissance
were led to perceive by their brothers the painters;
and having perceived, they were dissatisfied at having
to omit in their representation. But how show that
they too had seen them?</p>

<p>Here return to our notice two other peculiarities
which distinguish medi&aelig;val sculpture from antique:
first, that medi&aelig;val sculpture, rarely called upon for
free open-air figures, was for ever producing architectural
ornament, seen at a given height and against a
dark background; and indoor decoration seen under an
unvarying and often defective light; and secondly, that
medi&aelig;val sculpture was the handicraft of the subtle
carver in delicate stone.</p>

<p>The sculpture which was an essential part of Lombard
and Gothic architecture required a treatment that
should adapt it to its particular place and subordinate
it to a given effect. According to the height above the
eye and the direction of the light, certain details had
to be exaggerated, certain others suppressed; a sculptured
window, like those of Orsanmichele, would not
give the delightful pattern of black and white unless
some surfaces were more raised than others, some
portions of figure or leafage allowed to sink into
quiescence, others to start forward by means of the
black rim of undercutting; and a sepulchral monument,
raised thirty feet above the spectator's eye, like
those inside Sta. Maria Novella, would present a mere
intricate confusion unless the recumbent figure, the
canopy, and various accessories, were such as to seem
unnatural at the level of the eye. Thus, the heraldic
lions of one of these Gothic tombs have the black
cavity of the jaw cut by marble bars which are
absolutely out of proportion to the rest of the creature's
body, and to the detail of the other features, but render
the showing of the teeth even at the other side of the
transept. Again, in the more developed art of the
fifteenth century, Rossellino's Cardinal of Portugal
has the offside of his face shelved upwards so as to
catch the light, because he is seen from below, and the
near side would otherwise be too prominent; while
the beautiful dead warrior, by an unknown sculptor, at
Ravenna has had a portion of his jaw and chin deliberately
cut away, because the spectator is intended to
look down upon his recumbent figure. If we take a
cast of the Cardinal's head and look down upon it, or
hang a cast of the dead warrior on the wall, the whole
appearance alters; the expression is almost reversed
and the features are distorted. On the other hand, a
cast from a real head, placed on high like the Cardinal's,
would become insignificant, and laid at the height of
a table, like the dead warrior's, would look lumbering
and tumid. Thus, again, the head of Donatello's
Poggio, which is visible and intelligible placed high up
in the darkness of the Cathedral of Florence, looks as
if it had been gashed and hacked with a blunt knife
when seen in the cast at the usual height in an ordinary
light.</p>

<p>Now this subtle circumventing of distance, height,
and darkness; this victory of pattern over place; this
reducing of light and shadow into tools for the sculptor,
mean, as we see from the above examples, sacrificing
the reality to the appearance, altering the proportions
and planes so rigorously reproduced by the Greeks,
mean sacrificing the sacred absolute form. And such
a habit of taking liberties with what can be measured
by the hand, in order to please the eye, allowed the
sculptors of the Renaissance to think of their model
no longer as the homogeneous <i>white man</i> of the Greeks,
but as a creature in whom structure was accentuated,
intensified, or contradicted by colour and texture.</p>

<p>Furthermore, these men of the fifteenth century
possessed the cunning carving which could make stone
vary in texture, in fibre, and almost in colour.</p>

<p>A great many biographical details substantiate the
evidence of statues and busts that the sculptors of the
Renaissance carried on their business in a different
manner from the ancient Greeks. The great development
in Antiquity of the art of casting bronze, carried
on everywhere for the production of weapons and
household furniture, must have accustomed Greek
sculptors (if we may call them by that name) to limit
their personal work to the figure modelled in clay.
And the great number of their works, many tediously
constructed of ivory and gold, shows clearly that they
did not abandon this habit in case of marble statuary,
but merely gave the finishing strokes to a copy of their
clay model, produced by workmen whose skill must
have been fostered by the apparently thriving trade in
marble copies of bronzes.</p>

<p>It was different in the Renaissance. Vasari recommends,
as obviating certain miscalculations which frequently
happened, that sculptors should prepare large
models by which to measure the capacities of their
block of marble. But these models, described as made
of a mixture of plaster, size, and cloth shavings over
tow and hay, could serve only for the rough proportions
and attitude; nor is there ever any allusion to
any process of minute measurement, such as pointing,
by which detail could be transferred from the model to
the stone. Most often we hear of small wax models
which the sculptors enlarged directly in the stone.
Vasari, while exaggerating the skill of Michelangelo in
making his David out of a block mangled by another
sculptor, expresses no surprise at his having chopped
the marble himself; indeed, the anecdote itself affords
evidence of the commonness of such a practice, since
Agostino di Duccio would not have spoilt the block if
he had not cut into it rashly without previous
comparison with a model.<a href="#fn17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></a><a name="fn17r" id="fn17r"></a> "We hear, besides, that Jacopo
della Quercia spent twelve years over one of the gates
of S. Petronio, and that other sculptors carried out
similar great works with the assistance of one man, or
with no assistance at all,&mdash;a proceeding which would
have seemed the most frightful waste except in a time
and country where half of the sculptors were originally
stone-masons and the other half goldsmiths, that is to
say, men accustomed to every stage, coarse or subtle,
of their work. The absence of replicas of Renaissance
sculpture, so striking a contrast to the scores of repetitions
of Greek works, proves, moreover, that the actual
execution in marble was considered an intrinsic part
of the sculpture of the fifteenth century, in the same
way as the painting of a Venetian master. Phidias
might leave the carving of his statues to skilful workmen,
once he had modelled the clay, even as the
painters of the merely designing and linear schools,
Perugino, Ghirlandaio, or Botticelli, might employ
pupils to carry out their designs on panel or wall.
But in the same way as a Titian is not a Titian without
a certain handling of the brush, so a Donatello
is not a Donatello, or a Mino not a Mino, without a
certain individual excellence in the cutting of the
marble.</p>

<p>These men brought, therefore, to the cutting of
marble a degree of skill and knowledge of which the
ancients had no notion, as they had no necessity. In
their hands the chisel was not merely a second modelling
tool, moulding delicate planes, uniting insensibly
broad masses of projection and depression. It was a
pencil, which, according as it was held, could emphasise
the forms in sharp hatchings or let them die away
unnoticed in subdued, imperceptible washes. It was
a brush which could give the texture and the values
of the colour&mdash;a brush dipped in various tints of light
and darkness, according as it poured into the marble the
light and the shade, and as it translated into polishings
and rough hewings and granulations and every variety
of cutting, the texture of flesh, of hair, and of drapery;
of the blonde hair and flesh of children, the coarse
flesh and bristly hair of old men, the draperies of wool,
of linen, and of brocade. The sculptors of Antiquity
took a beautiful human being&mdash;a youth in his perfect
flower, with limbs trained by harmonious exercise and
ripened by exposure to the air and sun&mdash;and, correcting
whatever was imperfect in his individual forms by
their hourly experience of similar beauty, they copied
in clay as much as clay could give of his perfections:
the subtle proportions, the majestic ampleness
of masses, the delicate finish of limbs, the harmonious
play of muscles, the serene simplicity of look and
gesture, placing him in an attitude intelligible and
graceful from the greatest possible distance and from
the largest variety of points of view. And they preserved
this perfect piece of loveliness by handing it
over to the faithful copyist in marble, to the bronze,
which, more faithful still, fills every minutest cavity
left by the clay. Being beautiful in himself, in all his
proportions and details, this man of bronze or marble
was beautiful wherever he was placed and from wheresoever
he was seen; whether he appeared foreshortened
on a temple front, or face to face among the laurel
trees, whether shaded by a portico, or shining in the
blaze of the open street. His beauty must be judged
and loved as we should judge and love the beauty of
a real human being, for he is the closest reproduction
that art has given of beautiful reality placed in
reality's real surroundings. He is the embodiment of
the strength and purity of youth, untroubled by the
moment, independent of place and of circumstance.</p>

<p>Of such perfection, born of the rarest meeting of happy
circumstances, Renaissance sculpture knows nothing.
A lesser art, for painting was then what sculpture had
been in Antiquity; bound more or less closely to the
service of architecture; surrounded by ill-grown, untrained
bodies; distracted by ascetic feelings and scientific
curiosities, the sculpture of Donatello and Mino, of
Jacopo della Quercia and Desiderio da Settignano, of
Michelangelo himself, was one of those second artistic
growths which use up the elements that have been
neglected or rejected by the more fortunate and vigorous
efflorescence which has preceded. It failed in
everything in which antique sculpture had succeeded; it
accomplished what Antiquity had left undone. Its
sense of bodily beauty was rudimentary; its knowledge
of the nude alternately insufficient and pedantic; the
forms of Donatello's David and of Benedetto's St. John
are clumsy, stunted, and inharmonious; even Michelangelo's
Bacchus is but a comely lout. This sculpture
has, moreover, a marvellous preference for ugly old men&mdash;gross,
or ascetically imbecile; and for ill-grown striplings:
except the St. George of Donatello, whose body,
however, is entirely encased in inflexible leather and
steel, it never gives us the perfection and pride of youth.
These things are obvious, and set us against the art as
a whole. But see it when it does what Antiquity never
attempted; Antiquity which placed statues side by side
in a gable, balancing one another, but not welded into
one pattern; which made relief the mere repetition of
one point of view of the round figure, the shadow of
the gable group; which, until its decline, knew nothing
of the pathos of old age, of the grotesque exquisiteness
of infancy, of the endearing awkwardness of adolescence;
which knew nothing of the texture of the skin, the silkiness
of the hair, the colour of the eye.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>III</h3>

<p>Let us see Renaissance sculpture in its real achievement.</p>

<p>Here are a number of children by various sculptors
of the fifteenth century. This is the tiny baby whose
little feet still project from a sort of gaiter of flesh,
whose little boneless legs cannot carry the fat little
paunch, the heavy big head. Note that its little skull
is still soft, like an apple, under the thin floss hair. Its
elder brother or sister is still vaguely contemplative of
the world, with eyes that easily grow sleepy in their
blueness. Those a little older have learned already that
the world is full of solemn people on whom to practise
tricks; their features have scarcely accentuated, their
hair has merely curled into loose rings, but their eyes
have come forward from below the forehead, eyes and
forehead working together already; and there are great
holes, into which you may dig your thumb, in the cheeks.
Those of fourteen or fifteen have deplorably thin arms,
and still such terrible calves; and a stomach telling
of childish gigantic meals; but they have the pert,
humorous frankness of Verrocchio's David, who certainly
flung a jest at Goliath's unwieldy person together
with his stone; or the delicate, sentimental pretty
woman's grace of Donatello's St. John of the Louvre,
and Benedetto da Maiano's: they will soon be poring
over the <i>Vita Nuova</i> and Petrarch. Two other St.
Johns&mdash;I am speaking of Donatello's&mdash;have turned out
differently. One, the first beard still doubtful round
his mouth, has already rushed madly away from earthly
loves; his limbs are utterly wasted by fasting; except
his legs, which have become incredibly muscular from
continual walking; he has begun to be troubled by
voices in the wilderness&mdash;whether of angels or of
demons&mdash;and he flies along, his eyes fixed on his scroll,
and with them fixing his mind on unearthly things; he
will very likely go mad, this tempted saint of twenty-one.
Here he is again, beard and hair matted, almost
a wild man of the woods, but with the gravity and self-possession
of a preacher; he has come out of the wilderness,
overcome all temptations, his fanaticism is now
militant and conquering. This is certainly not the
same man, but perhaps one of his listeners, this old
King David of Donatello&mdash;a man at no time intelligent,
whose dome-shaped head has taken back, with the thin
white floss hair that recalls infancy, an infantine lack
of solidity; whose mouth is drooping already, perhaps
after a first experience of paralysis, and his eyes getting
vague in look; but who, in this intellectual and
physical decay, seems to have become only the more
full of gentleness and sweetness; misnamed David, a
Job become reconciled to his fate by becoming indifferent
to himself, an Ancient Mariner who has seen
the water-snakes and blessed them and been filled with
blessing.</p>

<p>These are all statues or busts intended for a given
niche or bracket, a given portico or window, but in a
measure free sculpture. Let us now look at what is
already decoration. Donatello's Annunciation, the big
coarse relief in friable grey stone (incapable of a sharp
line), picked out with delicate gilding; no fluttering or
fainting, the angel and the Virgin grave, decorous, like
the neighbouring pilasters. Again, his organ-loft of
flat relief, with granulated groundwork: the flattened
groups of dancing children making, with deep, wide
shadows beneath their upraised, linked arms, a sort
of human trellis-work of black and white. Mino's
Madonna at Fiesole: the relief turned and cut so as
to look out of the chapel into the church, so that the
Virgin's head, receiving the light like a glory on the
pure, polished forehead, casts a nimbus of shadow round
itself, while the saints are sucked into the background,
their accessories only, staff and gridiron, allowed to
assert themselves by a sharp shadow; a marvellous
vision of white heavenly roses, their pointed buds and
sharp spines flourishing on martyrs' blood and incense,
grown into the close lips and long eyes, the virginal
body and thin hands of Mary. From these reliefs we
come to the compositions, group inside group, all
shelving into portico and forest vista, of the pulpit of
Sta. Croce, the perspective bevelling it into concavities,
like those of panelling; the heads and projecting
shoulders lightly marked as some carved knob or
ornament; to the magnificent compositions in light
and shade, all balancing and harmonising each other,
and framed round by garlands of immortal blossom
and fruit, of Ghiberti's gates.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. The sculpture of the Renaissance,
not satisfied with having portrayed the real human
being made of flesh and blood, of bone and skin, dark-eyed
or flaxen-haired, embodied in the marble the
impalpable forms of dreams. Its latest, greatest, works
are those sepulchres of Michelangelo, whose pinnacle
enthrones strange ghosts of warriors, and whose steep
sides are the unquiet couch of divinities hewn, you
would say, out of darkness and the light that is as
darkness.</p>

 <p class="noindent"><small>BEING THE LIFE OF DOMENICO NERONI, PICTOR SACRILEGUS</small>
 </p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every time, of late years, of my being once more in
Rome, I have been subject to a peculiar mental obsession:
retracing my steps, if not materially, in fancy at
least, to such parts of the city as bear witness to the
strange meeting of centuries, where the Middle Ages
have altered to their purposes, or filled with their
significance, the ruined remains of Antiquity.</p>

<p>Such places are scarcer than one might have expected,
and for that reason perhaps more impressive,
more fragmentary and enigmatic. There are the colossal
columns&mdash;great trickles and flakes of black etching as
with acid their marble&mdash;of the temple of Mars Ultor,
with that Tuscan palace of Torre della Milizia rising
from among them. There is, inside Ara C&oelig;li&mdash;itself
commemorating the legend of Augustus and the Sibyl&mdash;the
tomb of Dominus Pandulphus Sabelli, its borrowed
vine-garlands and satyrs and Cupids surmounted
by mosaic crosses and Gothic inscriptions; and outside
the same church, on a ground of green and gold, a
Mother of God looking down from among gurgoyles
and escutcheons on to the marble river-god of the yard
of the Capitol below. Then also, where pines and
laurels still root in the unrifled tombs, the skeleton
feudal fortress, gutted as by an earthquake, alongside
of the tower of C&aelig;cilia Metella. These were the places
to which my thoughts were for ever recurring; to
them, and to nameless other spots, the street-corner,
for instance, where an Ionic pillar, with beaded and
full-horned capital, is walled into the side of an insignificant
modern house. I know not whether, in consequence
of this straining to see the meeting-point of
Antiquity and the Middle Ages (like the fancy, sometimes
experienced, to reach the confluence of rivers), or
rather as a cause thereof, but a certain story has long
lurked in the corners of my mind. Twenty years have
passed since first I was aware of its presence, and
it has undergone many changes. It is presumably a
piece of my inventing, for I have neither read it nor
heard it related. But by this time it has acquired a
certain traditional veracity in my eyes, and I give to
the reader rather as historical fact than as fiction the
study which I have always called to myself: <i>Pictor
Sacrilegus</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>I</h3>

<p>Domenico, the son of Luca Neroni, painter, sculptor,
goldsmith, and engraver, about whom, owing either to
the scarcity of his works or the scandal of his end,
Vasari has but a few words in another man's
biography, must have been born shortly before or shortly
after the year 1450, a contemporary of Perugino, of
Ghirlandaio, of Filippino Lippi, and of Signorelli, by
all of whom he was influenced at various moments, and
whom he influenced by turns.</p>

<p>He was born and bred in the Etruscan town of
Volterra, of a family which for generations had exercised
the art of the goldsmith, stimulated, perhaps, by
the sight of ornaments discovered in Etruscan tombs,
and carrying on, peradventure, some of the Etruscan
traditions of two thousand years before. The mountain
city, situate on the verge of the malarious seaboard of
Southern Tuscany, is reached from one side through
windings of barren valleys, where the dried-up brooks
are fringed, instead of reed, with the grey, sand-loving
tamarisk; and from the other side, across a high-lying
moorland of stunted heather and sere grass, whence the
larks rise up scared by only a flock of sheep or a mare
and her foal, and you journey for miles without meeting
a house or a clump of cypresses. In front, with the
white road zigzagging along their crests, is a wilderness
of barren, livid hillocks, separated by huge fissures and
crevassed by huge cracks, with here and there separate
rocks, projecting like Druidic stones from the valley of
gaping ravines; and beyond them all a higher mountain,
among whose rocks and ilexes you doubtfully
distinguish the walls and towers of the Etruscan city.
A mass of Cyclopean wall and great black houses, grim
with stone brackets and iron hooks and stanchions, all
for defence and barricade, Volterra looks down into the
deep valleys, like the vague heraldic animal, black and
bristly, which peers from the high tower of the municipal
palace. One wonders how this could ever have
been a city of the fat, voluptuous Etruscans, whose
images lie propped up and wide-eyed on their stone
coffin-lids. The long wars of old Italic times, in which
Etruria fell before Rome, must have burned and destroyed,
as one would think, the land as well as the inhabitants,
leaving but grey cinders and blackened stone
behind. Siena and Florence ruined Volterra once more
in the Middle Ages, isolating it near the pestilential
Maremma and checking its growth outward and inward.
The cathedral, the pride of a medi&aelig;val commonwealth,
is still a mean and unfinished building of the twelfth
century. There is no native art, of any importance, of
a later period; what the town possesses has come from
other parts, the altar-pieces by Matteo di Giovanni
and Signorelli, for instance, and the marble candelabra,
carried by angels, of the school of Mino da Fiesole.</p>

<p>In this remote and stagnant town, the artistic training
of Domenico Neroni was necessarily imperfect and
limited throughout his boyhood to the paternal goldsmith's
craft. Indeed, it seems likely that some
peculiarities of his subsequent life as an artist, his
laboriousness disproportionate to all results, his persistent
harping on unimportant detail, and his exclusive
interest in line and curve, were due not merely to
an unhappy and laborious temperament, but also to
the long habit of an art full of manual skill and
cunning tradition, which presented the eye with ingenious
patterns, but rarely attempted, save in a few
church ornaments, more of the domain of sculpture, to
tell a story or express a feeling.</p>

<p>Besides this influence of his original trade, we find
in Domenico Neroni's work the influence of his early
surroundings. His native country is such as must
delight, or help to form, a painter of pale anatomies.
The painters of Southern Tuscany loved as a background
the arid and mountainous country of their
birth. Taddeo di Bartolo placed the Death of the
Virgin among the curious undulations of pale clay and
sandy marl that stretch to the southernmost gates of
Siena; Signorelli was amused and fascinated by the
odd cliffs and overhanging crags, unnatural and grotesque
like some Druidic monument, of the valleys
of the Paglia and the Chiana; and Pier della Francesca
has left, in the allegorical triumphs of Frederick
of Urbino and his duchess, studies most exquisite and
correct, of what meets the traveller's eyes on the watersheds
of the central Apennine, sharp-toothed lines of
mountain peaks pale against the sky, dim distant
whiteness of sea, and valleys and roads and torrents
twisting intricately as on a map. The country about
Volterra, revealing itself with rosy lividness at dawn,
with delicate periwinkle blue at sunset, through an
open city gate or a gap between the tall black houses,
helped to make Neroni a lover of muscle and sinew,
of the strength and suppleness of movement, of the
osseous structure divined within the limbs; and made
him shrink all his life long, not merely from drapery
or costume that blunted the lines of the body, but from
any warmth and depth of colour; till the figures stood
out like ghosts, or people in faded tapestries, from the
pale lilacs and greys and washed out cinnamons of his
backgrounds. For the bold peaks and swelling mountains
of the valleys of the Arno and the Tiber, and the
depths of colour among vegetation and rivers, seemed
crude and emphatic to a man who carried in his
memory those bosses of hill, pearly where the waters
have washed the sides, pale golden buff where a little
sere grass covers the rounded top; those great cracks
and chasms, with the white road snaking along the
narrow table-land and the wide valleys; and the ripple
of far-off mountain chains, strong and restrained in
curves, exquisite in tints, like the dry white and
purpled hemlock, and the dusty lilac scabius, which
seem to flower alone in that arid and melancholy and
beautiful country.</p>

<p>"Colour," wrote Domenico Neroni, among a mass
of notes on his art, measurements, and calculations, "is
the enemy of noble art. It is the enemy of all precise
and perfect form, since where colour exists form can
be seen only as juxtaposition of colour. For this
reason it has pleased the Creator to lend colour only
to the inanimate world, as to senseless vegetables and
plants, and to the lower kinds of living creatures, as
birds, fishes, and reptiles; whereas nobler creatures, as
lions, tigers, horses, cattle, stags, and unicorns, are
robed in white or dull skins, the noblest breeds, indeed,
both of horses, as those of the Soldans of Egypt
and Numidia, and of oxen, as those of the valleys of
the Clitumnus and Chiana, being white; whence, indeed,
the poet Virgil has said that such latter are
fittest for sacrifice to the immortal gods; 'hinc albi,
Clitumne, greges,' and what follows. And man, the
masterpiece of creation, is white; and only in the
less noble portions of his body, which have no sensitiveness
and no shape (being, indeed, vegetative and
deciduous), as hair and beard, partaking of colour.
Wherefore the ancient Romans and Greeks, portraying
their gods, chose white marble for material, and not
gaudy porphyry or jasper, and portrayed them naked.
Whence certain moderns, calling themselves painters,
who muffle our Lord and the Holy Apostles in many-coloured
garments, thinking thereby to do a seemly
and honourable thing, but really proceeding basely like
tailors, might take a lesson if they could."</p>

<p>The quotation from Virgil, and the allusion to the
statues of the immortal gods, shows that Neroni must
have written these lines in the later part of his career,
when already under the influence of that humanist
Filarete, who played so important a part in his life,
and when possessed already by those notions which
brought him to so strange and fearful an end. But
from his earliest years he sought for form, despising
other things. He passed with contempt through a
six months' apprenticeship at Perugia, railing at the
great factory of devotional art established there by
Perugino, of whom, with his rows of splay-footed
saints and spindle-shanked heroes, he spoke with the
same sweeping contempt as later Michelangelo. At
Siena, which he described (much as its earlier artists
painted it) as a town of pink toy-houses and scarlet
toy-towers, he found nothing to admire save the
marble fountain of Jacopo della Quercia, for the
antique group of the Three Graces, later to be drawn
by the young Raphael, had not yet been given to
the cathedral by the nephew of Pius II. The sight of
these noble reliefs, particularly of the one representing
Adam and Eve driven out of Paradise, with their
strong and well-understood nudities, determined him
to exchange painting for sculpture, and made him
hasten to Florence to see the works of Donatello and
of Ghiberti.</p>

<p>Domenico Neroni must have spent several years of
his life&mdash;between 1470 and 1480&mdash;in Florence, but
little of his work has remained in that city,&mdash;little, at
least, that we can identify with certainty. For taking
service, as he did, with the Pollaiolos, Verrocchio,
Nanni di Banco, and even with Filippino and Botticelli,
wherever his inquisitive mind could learn, or his
restless, fastidious, laborious talent gain him bread, it
is presumable that much of his work might be discovered
alongside that of his masters, in the collective
productions of the various workshops. It is possible
thus that he had a hand in much metal and relief
work of the Pollaiolos, and perhaps even in the embroidering
and tapestries of which they were undertakers;
also in certain ornaments, friezes of Cupids
and dolphins, and exquisite shell and acanthus carving
of the monuments of Santa Croce; and it may be surmised
that he occasionally assisted Botticelli in his
perspective and anatomy, since that master took him
to Rome when commissioned to paint in the chapel of
Pope Sixtus. Indeed, in certain little-known studies
for Botticelli's Birth of Venus and Calumny of Apelles
one may discover, in the strong sweep of the outline,
in the solid fashion in which the figures are planted on
their feet&mdash;all peculiarities which disappear in the
painted pictures, where grace of motion and exquisitive
research take the place of solid draughtsman-ship&mdash;the
hand of the artist whom the restless desire
to confront ever new problems alone prevented from
attaining a place among the great men of his time.</p>

<p>For there was in Domenico Neroni, from the very
outset of his career, a curiosity after the hidden, a
passion for the unattainable, which kept him, with
greater power than many of his contemporaries, and
vastly greater science, a mere student throughout his
lifetime. He resembled in some respects his great contemporary
Leonardo, but while the eager inquisitiveness
of the latter was tempered by a singular power
of universal enjoyment, a love of luxury and joyousness
in every form, the intellectual activity of Neroni
was exasperated into a kind of unhappy mania by the
fact that its satisfaction was the only happiness that
he could conceive. He would never have understood,
or understanding would have detested, the luxurious
<i>dilettante</i> spirit which made Leonardo prefer painting
to sculpture, because whereas the sculptor is covered
with a mud of marble dust, and works in a place disorderly
with chips and rubbish, the painter "sits at
his easel, well dressed and at ease, in a clean house
adorned with pictures, his work accompanied by music
or the reading of delightful books, which, untroubled
by the sound of hammering and other noises, may be
listened to with very great pleasure." The workshop
of Neroni, when he had one of his own, was full of
cobwebs and dust, littered with the remains of frugal
and unsavoury meals, and resolutely closed to the rich
and noble persons in whose company Leonardo delighted.
And if Neroni, in his many-sided activity,
eventually put aside sculpture for painting, it was
merely because, as he was wont to say, a figure must
needs look real when it is solid and you can walk
round it; but to make men and women rise out of a
flat canvas or plastered wall, and stand and move as
if alive, is truly the work of a god.</p>

<p>Men and women, said Neroni; and he should have
added men and women nude. For the studies which he
made of the anatomy of horses and dogs were destined
merely to shed light on the construction of human
creatures; and his elaborate and exquisite drawings of
undulating hills and sinuous rivers, nay, of growths of
myrtle and clumps of daffodils, were intended as practice
towards drawing the more subtle lines and curves
of man's body. And as to clothes, he could not understand
that great anatomists like Signorelli should
huddle their figures quite willingly in immense cloaks
and gowns; still less how exquisite draughtsmen like his
friend Botticelli (who had the sense of line like no other
man since Frate Lippo, although his people were oddly
out of joint) could take pleasure in putting half-a-dozen
veils atop of each other, and then tying them all into
bunches and bunches with innumerable bits of tape!
As to himself, he invariably worked out every detail of
the nude, in the vain hope that the priests and monks
for whom he worked would allow at least half of those
beautiful anatomies to remain visible; and when, with
infinite difficulties and bad language, he gradually gave
in to the necessity of some sort of raiment, it was of
such a nature&mdash;the hose and jerkins of the men-at-arms
like a second skin, the draperies of the womankind as
clinging as if they had been picked out of the river,
that a great many pious people absolutely declined to
pay the agreed on sum for paintings more suited to
Pagan than to Christian countries; and indeed Fra
Girolamo Savonarola included much work of Domenico's
in his very finest burnings.</p>

<p>Such familiarity with nude form was not easily
attained in the fifteenth century. Medi&aelig;val civilisation
gave no opportunities for seeing naked or half-naked
people moving freely as in the antique pal&aelig;stra;
and there had yet been discovered too few antique
marbles for the empiric knowledge of ancient sculptors
to be empirically inherited by modern ones. Observation
of the hired model, utterly insufficient in itself,
required to be supplemented by a thorough science of
the body's mechanism. But physiology and surgery were
still in their infancy; and artists could not, as they could
after the teachings of Vesalius, Fallopius, and Cesalpinus,
avail themselves of the science accumulated for
medical purposes. Verrocchio and the Pollaiolos most
certainly, and Donatello almost without a doubt, practised
dissection as a part of their business, as Michelangelo,
with the advantage of twenty years of their
researches behind him, practised it passionately in his
turn. Of all the men of his day, Domenico Neroni,
however, was the most fervent anatomist. He ran
every risk of contagion and of punishment in order to
procure corpses from the hospital and the gibbet. He
undermined his constitution by breathing and handling
corruption, and when his friends implored him to spare
his health, he would answer, although unable to touch
food for sickness, by paraphrasing the famous words of
Paolo Uccello, and exclaiming from among his grisly
and abominable properties, "Ah! how sweet a thing is
not anatomy!"</p>

<p>There was nothing, he said&mdash;for he spoke willingly
to any one who questioned him on these subjects&mdash;more
beautiful than the manner in which human beings
are built, or indeed living creatures of any kind; for,
in the scarcity of corpses and skeletons, he would pick
up on his walks the bones of sheep that had died on
the hill-sides, or those of horses and mules furbished
up by the scavenger dogs of the river-edge. It was
marvellous to listen to him when he was in the vein.
He sat handling horrible remains and talking about
them like a lover about his mistress or a preacher about
God; indeed, bones, muscles, and tendons were mistress
and god all in one to this fanatical lover of human form.
He would insist on the loveliness of line of the scapula,
finding in the sweep of the <i>acromion</i> ridge a fanciful
resemblance to the pinion, and in the angular shape of
the <i>coracoid</i> process to the neck and head of a raven in
full flight. Following with his finger the triangular
outline of the bone, he went on to explain how its freedom
of movement is due to its singular independence;
laid loosely on the flat muscles behind the upper ribs,
it moves with absolute freedom, backwards and forwards,
up and down, unconnected with any other bone,
till, turning the corner of the shoulder, it is hinged
rather than tied to the collar-bone; the collar-bone
itself free to move upwards from its articulation in the
sternum. And then talk of the great works of man!
Talk of Brunellesco and his cupola, of the engineers of
the Duke of Calabria! Look at the human arm: what
engineer would have dared to fasten anything to such
a movable base as that? Yet an arm can swing round
like a windmill, and lift weights like the stoutest crane
without being wrenched out of its sockets, because the
muscles act as pulleys in four different directions.
And see, under the big <i>deltoid</i>, which fits round the
shoulder like an epaulette and pulls the arm up, is the
scapular group, things like tidily sorted skeins, thick
on the shoulder-blades, diminished to a tendon string
at their insertion in the arm; their business is to pull
the arm back, in opposition to the big pectoral muscle
which pulls it forwards. Here you have your arm
working up, backwards or forwards; but how about
pulling it down? An exquisite little arrangement
settles that. Instead of being inserted with the rest
on the outside of the arm-bone, the lowest muscle takes
another road, and is inserted in the under part of the
bone, in company with the great <i>latissimus dorsi</i>, and
these tightening while the <i>deltoid</i> slackens, pull the arm
down. No other arrangement could have done it with
so little bulk; and an additional muscle on the under-arm
or the ribs would have spoilt the figure of Apollo himself.</p>

<p>Among the paintings of contemporary artists, the
one which at that time afforded Domenico the most
unmingled satisfaction was Pollaiolo's tiny panel of
Hercules and the Hydra. There! You might cover
it with the palm of your hand; but in that hand you
would be holding the concentrated strength and valour
of the world, the true son of Jove, the most beautiful
muscles that ever were seen! At least the most
beautiful save in the statues of Donatello; for, of
course, Donato was the greatest craftsman that had ever
lived; and Domenico spoke of him as, in Vasari's day,
men were to speak of Michelangelo.</p>

<p>For I ask you, who save an angel in human shape
could have modelled that David, so young and triumphant
and modest, treading on Goliath's head, with
toes just slightly turned downwards, and those sandals,
of truly divine workmanship? And that St. John in
the Wilderness&mdash;how beautiful are not his ribs, showing
under the wasted pectoral muscles; and how one sees
that the <i>radius</i> rolls across the <i>ulna</i> in the forearm;
surely one's heart, rather than the statue, must be
made of stone if one can contemplate without rapture
the exquisite rendering of the texture where the shin-bone
stands out from the muscles of the leg. Such
must have been the works of those famous Romans
and Greeks, Phidias and Praxiteles.</p>

<p>Such were the notions of Domenico of Volterra in
the earlier part of his career. For a change came
gradually upon him after his first visit to Rome,
whither, about 1480, he accompanied Botticelli, Rosselli,
and Ghirlandaio, whom His Beatitude Pope Sixtus
had sent for to decorate the new chapel of the palace.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>We must not be deluded, like Domenico Neroni during
his Florentine days, into the easy mistake of considering
mere realism as the veritable aim of the art of
his days. Deep in the life of that art, and struggling
for ever through whatever passion for scientific accuracy,
technical skill, or pathetic expression, is the sense
of line and proportion, the desire for pattern, growing
steadily till its triumph under Michelangelo and
Raphael.</p>

<p>This reveals itself earliest in architecture. The men
of the fifteenth century had lost all sense of the logic
of construction. Columns, architraves, friezes, and
the various categories of actual stone and brick work,
occurred to them merely as so much line and curve,
applicable to the surface of their buildings, with not
more reference to their architecture than a fresco or
an arras. The Pazzi Chapel, for instance, is one agglomeration
of architectural members which perform no
architectural function; but, taken as a piece of surface
decoration, say as a stencilling, what could be more harmonious?
Or take Alberti's famous church at Rimini;
it is but a great piece of architectural veneering, nothing
that meets the eye doing any real constructive
duty, its exquisite decoration no more closely connected
with the building than the strips of damask and yards
of gold braid used in other places on holidays. As
the fifteenth century treats the architectural detail of
Gr&aelig;co-Roman art, so likewise does it proceed with its
sculptured ornament; all meaning vanishes before the
absorbing interest in pattern. For there is in antique
architectural ornament a much larger proportion of
significance than can strike us at first. Thus the
garlands of ivy and fruit had actually hung round the tomb
before being carved on its sides; before ornamenting
its corners the rams' heads and skulls of oxen had lain
for centuries on the altar. The medallions of nymphs,
centaurs, tritons, which to us are so meaningless and
irrelevant, had a reference either to the divinity or to
the worshippers; and there is probably almost as much
spontaneous symbolism in the little cinerary box in the
Capitol (of a person called Felix), with its variously
employed genii, making music, carrying lanterns and
torches, burning or extinguished under a trellis hung
with tragic masks, as in any Gothic tomb with angels
drawing the curtains of the deathbed. There has been,
with the change of religion, an interruption in the
symbolic tradition; yet, though we no longer interpret
with readiness this dead language of paganism, we feel,
if we are the least attentive, that it contains a real
meaning. We feel that the sculptors cared not merely
for the representation, but also for the object represented.
These things were dear to them, a part of
their life, their worship, their love; and they put as
much observation into their work as any Gothic sculptor,
and often as much fancy and humour (though both more
beautiful), as one may judge, with plenty of comparison
at hand, by a certain antique altar in Siena Cathedral,
none of whose Gothic animals come up to the wonderful
half-human rams' heads and bored, cross griffins of
this forlorn fragment of paganism. The significance
of classic ornament the men of the fifteenth century
straightway overlooked. They laid hold of it as merely
so much form, joining sirens, griffins, garlands, rams'
heads, victories, without a suspicion that they might
mean or suggest anything. They do, in fact, mean
nothing, in most Florentine work, besides exquisite
pattern; in the less subtle atmosphere of Venice they
reach that frank senselessness which has moved the
wrath of Ruskin. But what a charm have not even
those foolish monuments of doges and admirals, tier
upon tier of triumphal arch, of delicately flowered
column and scalloped niche, and then rows of dainty
warriors and virtues; how full of meaning to the eye
and spirit is not this art so meaningless to the literary
mind!</p>

<p>Of course the painting of that age never became an
art of mere pattern like the architecture. The whole
life and thought of the time was poured into it; and
the art itself developed in its upward movement a number
of scientific interests&mdash;perspective, anatomy, expression&mdash;which
counteracted that tendency to seek for
mere beauty of arrangement and detail. Yet the perfection
of Renaissance art never lies in any realism in
our modern sense, still less in such suggestiveness as
belongs to our literary age; and its triumph is when
Raphael can vary and co-ordinate the greatest number
of heads, of hands, feet, and groups, as in the School of
Athens, the Parnassus, the marvellous little Bible histories
of the Loggie; above all, in that "Vision of
Ezekiel," which is the very triumph of compact and
harmonious composition; when Michelangelo can tie
human beings into the finest knots, twist them into the
most shapely brackets, frameworks, and key-stones.
Even throughout the period of utmost realism, while
art was struggling with absorbing problems, men never
dreamed of such realism as ours. They never painted
a corner of nature at random, merely for the sake of
veracity; they never modelled a modern man or woman
in their real everyday dress and at their real everyday
business. In the midst of everything composition
ruled supreme, and each object must needs find its echo,
be worked into a scheme of lines, or, with the Venetians,
of symmetrically arranged colours. There is an anatomical
engraving by Antonio Pollaiolo, one of the
strongest realists of his time, which sums up the
tendencies of fifteenth-century art. It is a combat
of twelve naked men, extraordinarily hideous and in
hideous attitudes, but they are so arranged that their
ungainly and flayed-looking limbs form with the background
of gigantic ivy tendrils an intricate and beautiful
pattern, such as we find in Morris's paper and stuffs.</p>

<p>This hankering after pattern, this desire for beauty
as such, became manifest in Domenico Neroni after his
first sojourn in Rome.</p>

<p>The Roman basilicas, with their stately rows of
columns, Corinthian and Ionic, taken from some former
temple, and their sunken floor, solemn with Byzantine
patterns of porphyry and serpentine, had impressed
with their simplicity and harmony the mind of this
Florentine, surrounded hitherto by the intricacies of
Gothic buildings. They had formed the link to those
fragments of ancient architecture, more intact but also
more hidden than in our days, whose dignity of proportion
and grace of detail&mdash;vast rosetted arches and
slender rows of fluted pillars&mdash;our modern and Hellenicised
taste has treated with too ready contempt. For
this Vitruvian art, unoriginal and bungling in the eyes
of our purists, was yet full of the serenity, the ampleness
which the Middle Ages lacked, and affected the men
of the fifteenth century much like a passage of Virgil
after a canto of Dante. It formed the fit setting for
those remains of antique sculpture which were then
gradually beginning to be drawn from the earth. Of
such statues and reliefs&mdash;which the men of the Renaissance
regarded as the work rather of ancient Rome than
of Greece&mdash;a certain amount was beginning to be carried
all over Italy, and notably to the houses of the rich
Florentine merchants, who incrusted their staircase
walls with inscriptions and carvings, and set statues
and sarcophagi under the columns of their courtyards.
But such sculpture was chosen rather for its portable
character than its excellence; and although single busts
and slabs were diligently studied by Florentine artists,
there could not have existed in Florence a number of
antiques sufficient to impress the ideal of ancient art
upon men surrounded on all sides by the works of
medieval painters and sculptors.</p>

<p>To the various sights of Rome must be due that
sudden enlarging of style, that kind of new classicism,
which distinguishes the work of fifteenth-century
masters after their visit to the Eternal City, enabling
Ghirlandaio, Signorelli, Perugino, and Botticelli to
make the Sixtine Chapel, and even the finical Pinturicchio,
the Vatican library, into centres of fresh
influence for harmony and beauty.</p>

<p>The result upon Domenico Neroni was a momentary
confusion in all his artistic conceptions. Too much of
a seeker for new things, for secret and complicated
knowledge, to undergo a mere widening of style like
his more gifted or more placid contemporaries, he fell
foul of his previous work and his previous masters,
without finding a new line or new ideals. The frescoes
of Castagno, the little panels of the Pollaiolos, nay, even
the works of Donatello, were no longer what they had
seemed before his Roman journey, and even what he
had remembered them in Rome; for it is with more
noble things, even as with the rooms which we inhabit,
which strike us as small and dingy only on returning
from larger and better lighted ones.</p>

<p>It is to this period of incipient but ill-understood
classicism that belongs the only work of Domenico
Neroni&mdash;at least the only work still extant nowadays&mdash;which
possesses, over and above its artistic or scientific
merit, that indefinable quality which we must
simply call <i>charm</i>; to this time, with the one exception
of the famous woodcuts done for Filarete. Domenico
began about this time, and probably under the
stress of necessity, to make frontispieces for the books
with which Florentine printers were rapidly superseding
the manuscripts of twenty years before: collections
of sermons, of sonnets, lives of saints, editions of Virgil
and Terence, quaint versified encyclop&aelig;dias, and even
books on medicine and astrology. From these little
woodcuts, groups of saints round the Cross, with Giotto's
tower and Brunellesco's dome in the distance, pictures
of Fathers of the Church or ancient poets seated at
desks in neatly panelled closets&mdash;always with their
globes, books, and pot of lilies, and a vista of cloisters;
or battles between chaste viragos, in flying Botticellian
draperies, and slim, naked Cupids; from such frontispieces
Domenico passed on to larger woodcuts, destined
to illustrate books never printed, or perhaps, like the
so-called <i>playing cards of Mantegna</i> and certain prints
of Robetta, to be bought as cheap ornaments for walls.
Some of those that remain to us have a classical stiffness,
reminding one of the Paduan school; others, and these
his best, remind one of the work of Botticelli. There
is, for instance, the figure of a Muse, elaborately
modelled under her ample drapery, seated cross-legged
by a playing fountain, on a carpet of exquisitely
designed ground-ivy, a little bare trellis behind her, a
tortoise lyre in her hand; which has in it somewhat of
that odd, vague, questioning character, half of eagerness,
half of extreme lassitude, which we find in Botticelli.
Only that in Neroni's work it seems not the
outcome of a certain dreamy spiritual dissatisfaction&mdash;the
dissatisfaction which makes us feel that Botticelli's
flower-wreathed nymphs may end in the pool under
the willows like Ophelia&mdash;but rather of a torturing
of line and attitude in search of grace. Grace! Unclutchable
phantom, which had appeared tantalisingly
in Neroni's recollections of the antique, a something
ineffable, which he could not even see clearly when it
was there before him, accustomed as he had been to all
the hideousness of anatomised reality. In these woodcuts
he seems hunting it for ever; and there is one
of them which is peculiarly significant, of a nymph in
elaborately wound robes and veils, striding, with an
odd, mad, uncertain swing, through fields of stiff grass
and stunted rushes, a baby faun in her bosom, another
tiny goat-legged creature led by the hand, while she
carries uncomfortably, in addition to this load, a silly
trophy of wild-flowers tied to a stick; the personification
almost, this lady with the wide eyes and crazy
smile, of the artist's foolishly and charmingly burdened
journey in quest of the unattainable. The imaginative
quality, never intended or felt by the painter himself,
here depends on his embodying longings after the calm
and stalwart goddesses on sarcophagus and vase, in the
very thing he most seeks to avoid, a creature borrowed
from a Botticelli allegory, or one of the sibyls of the
unspeakable Perugino himself! The circumstances of
this quest, and the accidental meeting in it of the
antique and the medi&aelig;val, the straining, the Quixote-riding
or Three-King pilgrimaging after a phantom,
gives to such work of Domenico's that indefinable
quality of <i>charm</i>; the man does not indeed become a
poet, but in a measure a subject for poetry.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>III</h3>

<p>In order to understand what must have passed in the
mind of one of those Florentines of the fifteenth century,
we must realise the fact that, unlike ourselves,
they had not been brought up under the influence of
the antique, and, unlike the ancients, they had not
lived in intimacy with Nature. The followers of Giotto
had studied little beyond the head and hands, and as
much of the body as could be guessed at under drapery
or understood from movement; and this achievement,
with no artistic traditions save those of the basest
Byzantine decay, was far greater than we easily appreciate.
It remained for the men of the fifteenth century,
Donatello, Ghiberti, Masaccio, and their illustrious
followers, to become familiar with the human body.
To do so is easy for every one in our day, when we are
born, so to speak, with an unconscious habit of antique
form, diffused not merely by ancient works of art in
marble or plaster, but by more recent schools of art,
painting as well as sculpture, themselves the outcome
of classical imitation. The early Italian Renaissance
had little or none of these facilitations. Fragments of
Greek and Roman sculpture were still comparatively
uncommon before the great excavations of the sixteenth
century; nor was it possible for men so unfamiliar, not
merely with the antique, but with Nature itself, to
profit very rapidly by the knowledge and taste stored
up even in those fragments. It was necessary to learn
from reality to appreciate the antique, however much
the knowledge of the antique might later supplement,
and almost supplant, the study of reality. So these
men of the fifteenth century had to teach themselves,
in the first instance, the very elements of this knowledge.
And here their position, while yet so unlike
ours, was even more utterly unlike that of the ancients
themselves. The great art of Greece undoubtedly had
its days of ignorance; but for those ancient painters
and sculptors, who for generations had watched naked
lads exercising in the school or racecourse, and draped,
half-naked men and women walking in the streets and
working in the fields, their ignorance was of the means
of representation, not of the object represented. It is
the hand, the tool which is at fault in those constrained,
simpering warriors of the schools of &AElig;gina, in those
slim-waisted d&aelig;monic dancers of the Apulian vases;
the eye is as familiar with the human body, the mind
as accustomed to select its beauty from its ugliness, as
the eye and mind of such of us as cannot paint are
familiar nowadays with the shapes and colours, with
the charm of the trees and meadows that we love.
The contemporaries, on the contrary, of Donatello had
received from the sculptors of the very farthest Middle
Ages, those who carved the magnificent patterns of
Byzantine coffins and the exquisite leafage of Longobard
churches, a remarkable mastery over the technical
part of their craft. The hand was cunning, but the eye
unfamiliar. Hence it comes that the sculpture of the
earlier Renaissance displays perfection of workmanship,
which occasionally blinds us to its poverty of form, and
even to its deficiency of science. And hence also the
rapidity with which every additional item of knowledge
is put into practice that seems to argue perfect familiarity.
But these men were not really familiar with
their work. The dullest modern student, brought up
among casts and manuals, would not be guilty of the
actual anatomical mistakes committed every now and
then by these great anatomists, so passionately curious
of internal structure, so exquisitely faithful to minute
peculiarity, let alone the bunglings of men so certain
of their pencil, so exquisitely keen to form, as Botticelli.
As a matter of fact, every statue or drawn figure of this
period represents a hard fight with ignorance and with
unfamiliarity worse than ignorance. The grosser the
failure hard-by, the more splendid the real achievement.
For every limb modelled truthfully from the
life, every gesture rendered correctly, every bone or
muscle making itself felt under the skin, every crease
or lump in the surface, is so much conquered from
the unknown.</p>

<p>So long as this study, or rather this ignorance, continued,
the antique could be appreciated only very
partially, and almost exclusively in the points in
which it differed least from the works of these modern
men. It must have struck them by its unerring
science, its great truthfulness to nature, but its
superior beauty could not have appealed to artists too
unfamiliar with form to think of selecting it.</p>

<p>The study of antique proportion, the reproduction
of antique types, so visible in the sculptures of Michelangelo,
of Cellini, and of Sansovino, and no less in the
painting of Raphael, of Andrea, and even of the later
Venetians, was very unimportant in the school of
Donatello; and it is probable that he and his pupils
did not even perceive the difference between their
own works and the old marbles, which they studied
merely as so many realistic documents.</p>

<p>During his Florentine days Domenico Neroni, like
his masters, was unconscious of the real superiority of
the antique, and blind to its difference from what his
contemporaries and himself were striving to produce.
He did not perceive that the David of Donatello and
that of Verrocchio were unlike the marble gods and
heroes with whom he would complacently compare
them, nor that the bas-reliefs of the divine Ghiberti
were far more closely connected with the Gothic
work of Orcagna, even of the Pisans, than with those
sculptured sarcophagi collected by Cosimo and Piero
dei Medici. It was only when his insatiate curiosity
had exhausted those problems of anatomy which had
still troubled his teachers that he was able to see
what the antique really was, or rather to see that the
modern was not the same thing. Ghirlandaio, Filippino,
Signorelli, and Botticelli undoubtedly were affected
by a similar intuition of the Antique; but they were
diverted from its thorough investigation by the manifold
other problems of painting as distinguished from
sculpture, and by the vagueness, the unconsciousness
of great creative activity: the antique became one of
the influences in their development, helping very quietly
to enlarge and refine their work.</p>

<p>It was different with Domenico, in whom the man
of science was much more powerful than the artist.
His nature required definite decisions and distinct
formulas. It took him some time to understand that
the school of Donatello differed absolutely from the
antique, but the difference once felt, it appeared to
him with extraordinary clearness.</p>

<p>He never put his thoughts into words, and probably
never admitted even to himself that the works he had
most admired were lacking in beauty; he merely
asserted that the statues of the old Romans and
Greeks were astonishingly beautiful. In reality, however,
he was perpetually comparing the two, and
always to the disadvantage of the moderns. It is
possible in our day to judge justly the comparative
merits of antique sculpture and of that of the early
Renaissance; or rather to appreciate them as two
separate sorts of art, delightful in quite different ways,
letting ourselves be charmed not more by the actual
beauty of form, and nobility of movement of the one
than by the simplicity, the very homeliness, the
essentially human quality of the other. To us there
is something delightful in the very fact that the
Davids of Donatello and Verrocchio are mere ordinary
striplings from the street and the workshop, that the
singers of Luca della Robbia are simple unfledged
choir-boys, and the Virgins of Mino Florentine fine
ladies; we have enough of antique perfection, we have
had too much of pseudo-antique faultlessness, and we
feel refreshed by this unconsciousness of beauty and
ugliness. A contemporary could not enter into such
feelings, he could not enjoy his own and his fellows'
<i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>; besides, the antique was only just becoming
manifest, and therefore triumphant. To Domenico,
Donatello's David became more and more unsatisfactory,
faulty above the waist, positively ungainly below,
weak and lubberly; how could so divine an artist
have been satisfied with that flat back, those narrow
shoulders and thick thighs? He felt freer to dislike
the work of Verrocchio, his own teacher, and a man
without Donatello's overwhelming genius; that David
of his, with his immense head and wizen face, his
pitiful child's arms and projecting clavicles, straddling
with hand on hip; was it possible that a great hero,
the slayer of a giant (Domenico's notions of giants
were taken rather from the romances of chivalry recited
in the market than from study of Scripture)
should have been made like that? And so, like his
great contemporary Mantegna in far-off Lombardy,
Domenico turned that eager curiosity with which he
had previously sought for the secret of flayed limbs
and fleshless skeletons, to studying the mystery of
proportion and beauty which was hidden, more subtly
and hopelessly, in the broken marbles of the Pagans.</p>

<p>It happened one day, somewhere about the year
1485, that he was called to examine a group of
Bacchus and a Faun, recently brought from Naples by
the banker Neri Altoviti, of the family which once
owned a charming house, recently destroyed, whose
triple row of pillared balconies used to put an odd
Florentine note into the Papal Rome, turning the
swirl of the Tiber opposite Saint Angelo's into a reach
of the Arno. The houses of the Altovitis in Florence
were in that portion of the town most favoured by
the fifteenth century, already a little way from the
market: the lion on the tower of the Podest&agrave;, and the
Badia steeple printing the sky close by; while not far
off was the shop where the good bookseller Vespasiano
received orders for manuscripts, and conversed with the
humanists whose lives he was to write. The Albizis
and Pandolfinis, illustrious and numerous families,
struck in so many of their members by the vindictiveness
of the Medicis, had their houses in the same quarter,
and at the corner of the narrow street hung the carved
escutcheon&mdash;two fishes rampant&mdash;of the Pazzis: their
house shut up and avoided by the citizens, who had so
recently seen the conspirators dangling in hood and
cape from the windows of the public palace. The
house of the Altovitis was occupied on the ground floor
by great warehouses, whose narrow, grated windows
were attainable only by a steep flight of steps. The
court was surrounded on three sides by a cloister or
portico, which repeated itself on the first and second
floors, with the difference that the lowest arches were
supported by rude square pillars, ornamented with only
a carved marigold, while the uppermost weighed on
stout oaken shafts, between which ropes were stretched
for the drying of linen; and the middle colonnade consisted
of charming Tuscan columns, where Sirens and
Cupids and heraldic devices replaced the acanthus or
rams' horns of the capitals. It was to this middle portion
of the house that Domenico ascended up a noble
steep-stepped staircase, protected from the rain by a
vaulted and rosetted roof, for it was external and
occupied the side of the yard left free from cloisters.
The great banker had bidden Domenico to his midday
meal, which was served with a frugality now fast disappearing,
but once habitual even among the richest
Florentines. But though the food was simple and
almost scanty, nearly forty persons sat down to meat
together, for Neri Altoviti held to the old plan, commended
by Alberti in his dialogue on the governing of
a household, that the clerks and principal servants of
a merchant were best chosen among his own kinsfolk,
living under his roof, and learning obedience from the
example of his children. Despite this frugality, the
dining-room was, though bare, magnificent. There were
none of those carpets and Eastern stuffs which surprised
strangers from the North in the voluptuous little
palaces of contemporary Venetians, and the benches
were hard and narrow. But the ceiling overhead was
magnificently arranged in carved compartments, great
gold sunflowers and cherubs projecting from a dark blue
ground among the brown raftering; in the middle of
the stencilled wall was one of those high sideboards so
frequently shown in old paintings, covered with gold and
silver dishes and platters embossed by the most skilful
craftsmen; and at one end a great washing trough and
fountain, such as still exist in sacristies, ornamented
with groups of dancing children by Benedetto da
Maiano; while behind the high seat of the father of
the family a great group of saints, emerging from
blooming lilies and surrounded by a glory of angels,
was hanging in a frame divided into carved compartments:
the work, panel and frame, of the late Brother
Filippo Lippi. At one end of the board sat all the
men, arranged hierarchically, from the father in his
black loose robe to lads in short plaited tunic and
striped hose; the womankind were seated together, and
the daughters, even the mother of the house, modest
and almost nunlike in apparel and head-dress, would
rise and help to wait on the men, with that silent and
grave courtesy which, according to Vespasiano, had disappeared
from Florence with Alessandra dei Bardi.
There was little speech, and only in undertones; a
Franciscan said a long grace, and afterwards, and in
the middle of the meal, a young student, educated by
the frequent munificence of the Altovitis, read out
loud a chapter of Cicero's "De Senectute;" for Neri,
although a busy banker, with but little time for study,
was not behind his generation in the love of letters
and philosophy.</p>

<p>After meat Messer Neri dismissed the rest of the
company to their various avocations; the ladies silently
retired to superintend the ironing and mending of the
house linen, and Domenico was escorted by his host to see
the newly arrived piece of statuary. It had been placed
already in the banker's closet, where he could feast his
eyes on its perfection while attending to his business
or improving his mind by study. This closet, compared
to the rest of the house, was small and low-roofed.
At its end, as we see in the pictures of Van Eyck and
Memling, opened out the conjugal chamber, reflecting
its vast, red-covered bed, raised several steps, its crucifix
and praying-stool, and its latticed window in a circular
mirror framed in cut facets, which hung opposite on
the wall of the closet. The latter was dark, a single
trefoiled window admitting on either side of its column
and through its greenish bottle-glass but little light
from the narrow street. The chief furniture consisted
of shelves carrying books, small antique bronzes, some
globes, a sand-glass, and panel cupboards, ornamented
with pictures of similar objects, and with ingenious
perspectives of inlaid wood. An elaborate iron safe,
painted blue and studded with beautiful metal roses,
stood in a corner. There were two or three arm chairs
of carved oak for visitors. The master sat upon a bench
behind an oaken counter or desk, very much like St.
Jerome in his study. On the wall behind, and above
his head, hung a precious Flemish painting (Flemish
paintings were esteemed for their superior devoutness)
representing the Virgin at the foot of the Cross, with
a Nativity and a Circumcision on either of the opened
shutters. It made a glowing patch of vivid geranium
and wine colour, of warm yellow glazing on the oak
of the wall. On the counter or writing-table stood a
majolica pot with three lilies in it, a pile of manuscript
and ledgers, and a human skull alongside of a crucifix,
beautifully wrought of bronze by Desiderio da Settignano.
A Latin translation of Plato's "Ph&aelig;do" was
spread open on the desk, together with one of the
earliest printed copies of the "Divine Comedy."</p>

<p>Messer Neri did not take his seat at the counter,
but, after a pause, and with some solemnity, drew a
curtain of dark brocade which had been spread across
one end of the closet, and displayed his new purchase.</p>

<p>"I have it from the king, for the settling of a debt
of a thousand crowns contracted with my father, when
he was Duke of Calabria," said the banker, with due
appreciation of the sum. "'Tis said they found it
among the ruins of that famous palace of the Emperor
Tiberius of which Tacitus has told us."</p>

<p>The two marble figures, to which time and a long
sojourn underground had given a brownish yellow
colour, reddish in places with rust stains, stood out
against a background of Flemish tapestry, whose emaciated
heads of kings and thin bodies of warrior saints
made a confused pattern on the general dusky blue
and green. The group was in wonderful preservation:
the figure of Bacchus intact, that of the young faun
lacking only the arm, which had evidently been freely
extended.</p>

<p>It exists in many repetitions and variations in most
of our museums; a work originally of the school of
Praxiteles, but in none of the copies handed to us of
excellence sufficient to display the hand of the original
sculptor. Besides, we have been spoilt by familiarity
with an older and more powerful school, by knowledge
of a few great masterpieces, for complete appreciation
of such a work. But it was different four hundred
years ago; and Domenico Neroni stood long and
entranced before the group. The principal figure embodied
all those beauties which he had been striving
so hard to understand: it was, in the most triumphant
manner, the absolute reverse of the figures of Donatello.</p>

<p>The young god was represented walking with
leisurely but vigorous step, supporting himself upon
the shoulder of the little satyr as the vine supports
itself, with tendrils trailed about branches and trunk,
on the propping tree from which the child Ampelos
took his name. Like the head with its elaborately
dressed curls, the beautiful body had an ampleness and
tenderness that gave an impression almost womanly
till you noticed the cuirass-like sit of the chest on the
loins, and the compressed strength of the long light
thighs. The creature, as you looked at him, seemed
to reveal more and more, beneath the roundness and
fairness of surface, the elasticity and strength of an
athlete in training. But when the eye was not exploring
the delicate, hard, and yet supple depressions
and swellings of the muscles, the slender shapeliness
of the long legs and springy feet, the back bulging
with strong muscles above, and going in, tight, with
a magnificent dip at the waist; all impressions were
merged in a sense of ease, of suavity, of full-blown
harmony. Here was no pomp of anatomical lore, of
cunning handicraft, but the life seemed to circulate
strong and gentle in this exquisite effortless body.
And the creature was not merely alive with a life
more harmonious than that of living men or carved
marbles, but beautiful, equally in simple outline if you
chose that, and in subtle detail when that came under
your notice, with a beauty that seemed to multiply
itself, existing in all manners, as it can only in things
that have life, in perfect flowers and fruits, or high-bred
Oriental horses. Of such things did the under-strata
of consciousness consist in Neroni&mdash;vague impressions
of certain bunches of grapes with their great rounded
leaves hanging against the blue sky, of the flame-like
tapered petals of wild tulips in the fields, of the golden
brown flanks of certain horses, and the broad white
foreheads of the Umbrian bullocks; forming as it were
a background for the perception of this god, for no
man or woman had ever been like unto him.</p>

<p>Domenico remained silent, his arms folded on his
breast; it was not a case for talking.</p>

<p>But the young man who had read Cicero aloud at
table had come up behind him, and thought it more
seemly to praise his patron's new toy, while at the
same time displaying his learning; so he cleared his
throat, and said in a pompous manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is stated in the fifth chapter of the Geography
of Strabo that the painter Parrhasius, having been
summoned by the inhabitants of Lindos to make them
an image of their tutelary hero Hercules, obtained
from the son of Jupiter that he should appear to him
in a dream, and thus enable him worthily to portray
the perfections of a demigod. Might we not be
tempted to believe that the divine son of Semele had
vouchsafed a similar boon to the happy sculptor of this
marble?"</p>

<p>But Domenico only bit his thumb and sighed very
heavily.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>IV</h3>

<p>To the men of those days, which have taken their name
from the revival of classical studies, Antiquity, although
studied and aped till its phrases, feelings, and thoughts
had entered familiarly into all life, remained, nevertheless,
a period of permanent miracle. It was natural,
therefore, to the contemporaries of Poggius and &AElig;neas
Sylvius, of Ficinus and Politian, that the art of the
Romans and Greeks should, like their poetry, philosophy,
and even their virtues, be of transcendent and
unqualified splendour. Why it should be thus they
asked as little as why the sun shines, medi&aelig;val men
as they really were, and accepting quite simply certain
phenomena as the result of inscrutable virtues. Even
later, when Machiavelli began to examine why the
ancients had been more valorous and patriotic than his
contemporaries, nay, when Montaigne expounded with
sceptical cynicism the superior sanity and wisdom of
Pagan days, people were satisfied to think&mdash;when they
thought at all&mdash;that antique art was excellent because
it belonged to antiquity. And it was not till the middle
of the eighteenth century that the genius of Winkelmann
brought into fruitful contact the study of ancient
works of art, and that of the manners and notions of
antiquity, showing the influence of a civilisation which
cultivated bodily beauty as an almost divine quality,
and making us see behind that beautiful nation of
marble the generations of living athletes, among whom
the sculptor had found his critics and his models.</p>

<p>To a man like Domenico Neroni, devoid of classical
learning and accustomed to struggling with anatomy
and perspective, the problem of ancient art was not
settled by the fact of its antiquity. He had gone once
more to Rome on purpose to see as many old marbles
as possible, and he brought to their study the feverish
curiosity with which in former years he had flayed and
cut up corpses and spent his nights in calculations of
perspective. To such a mind, where modern scientific
methods were arising among medi&aelig;val habits of allegory
and mysticism, the statues and reliefs which he
was perpetually analysing became a sort of subsidiary
nature, whose riddles might be read by other means
than mere investigation; for do not the forces of Nature,
its elemental spirits, give obedience to wonderful words
and potent combinations of numbers?</p>

<p>Certain significant facts had flashed across his mind
in his studies of that almost abstract, nay, almost cabalistic
thing, the science of bodily proportions. It was
plain that the mystery of antique beauty&mdash;the ancient
symmetry, <i>symmetria prisca</i> as a humanist designs it
in his epitaph for Leonardo da Vinci&mdash;was but a matter
of numbers. For a man's length, if he stand with outstretched
arms, is the same from finger tip to finger tip
as his length when erect from head to feet, namely,
eight times the length of his head. Now eight heads,
if divided into halves, give four as the measure of
throat and thorax; and four heads to the length of the
leg from the acetabulum to the heel, divided themselves
into two heads going to the thigh and two heads to the
shank; while in the cross measurement two heads equal
the breadth of the chest, and three measure the length
from the shoulder to the middle finger. These measures&mdash;a
mere rough rule of thumb in our eyes&mdash;contained
to this medi&aelig;val mind the promise of some great
mystery. To him, accustomed to hear all the
occurrences of Nature, and all human concerns referred to
astrological calculations, and conceiving the universe as
governed by spirits&mdash;in shape, perhaps, like the Primum
Mobile, the Mercurius and Jupiter of Mantegna's playing
cards, crowned with stars and poised upon globes&mdash;it
was as if the divining rod were turning pertinaciously
to one spot in the earth, where, had he but the necessary
tools, he must strike upon veins of the purest gold,
or cause water to spirt high in the air. This number
<i>eight</i>, and the pertinacity of its recurrence, puzzled him
intensely. It seemed to point so clearly, much as in
music the sensitive seventh points to the tonic, to a sort
of resolution on the number nine. And if only nine
could be established, it would seem to explain so much&hellip;. For
five being man's numeral in creation (and is
not the measurement of his face also <i>five eyes</i>?), it
makes, when added to four, the number of the material
elements over which he dominates, <i>nine</i>, which would
thus represent the supremacy or perfection of man.
Man's power of reproduction being represented by
three, its multiple nine would be still more obviously
important. How to turn this eight into nine became
Domenico's study, and he took measurement after
measurement for this purpose. At length he remembered
that man's body is a unity, therefore represented
by the number one, and that will, judgment, and supremacy
are also comprised in the unit. Now one and
eight make nine beyond all possibility of doubt, and
the formula&mdash;"man's body is a unity&mdash;or one"&mdash;composed
of harmonies of eight, would give the formula
<i>nine</i> meaning <i>man's supremacy is expressed in his body</i>.
The importance of working round to this famous nine
will be clear when we reflect that, according to the
Kabbala and the lost sacred book of Hermes Trismegistus&mdash;the
Pimandra, doubtless, which he is represented,
on the floor of Siena Cathedral, as offering to a Jew and
a Gentile&mdash;nine represents the sun and all beautiful
bright things that draw their influence from it, as the
gleam of beaten gold, the rustle of silken stuffs, the
smell of the flower heliotrope, and all such men as delineate
human beings with colours, or make their effigy
in stone or metal; moreover, Ph&#339;bus Apollo, whom the
poets describe as the most beautiful of the gods, as
indeed he is represented in all statues and reliefs.</p>

<p>Domenico would often discuss these matters with
a learned man who greatly frequented his company.
This was the humanist Niccol&ograve; Feo, known as Filarete.
Filarete was a native of Southern Apulia, a bastard of
the house of the Counts of Sulmona, who, in order to
prevent any plots against the legitimate branch, had
handsomely provided for him in an abbey of which they
enjoyed the patronage. But his restless spirit drove
him from the cloister, and impelled him to long and
adventurous journeys. He had travelled in India and
the East, and in Greece, returning to Italy only when
Constantinople fell before the Turks. During these
years he had acquired immense learning, considerable
wealth, and a vaguely sinister reputation. He had been
persecuted by Paul II. for taking part in the famous
banquets, savouring oddly of Paganism, of Pomponius
L&aelig;tus; but the late Pontiff Sixtus IV. had taken him
into his favour together with Platina, one of his fellow-sufferers
in the castle of Saint Angelo. He was now
old, and, after a life of study, adventure, and possibly
of sin, was living in affluence in a house given him by
the illustrious Cardinal at St. Peter ad Vincula, who
had also obtained him a canonry of St. John Lateran.
He was busying his last year in a great work of fancy
and erudition, for which he required the assistance of a
skilful draughtsman and connoisseur of antiquities, than
whom none could suit him so well as Domenico Neroni.</p>

<p>The book of Filarete, of which the rare copies are
among the most precious relics of the Renaissance, was
a strange mixture of romance, allegory, and encyclop&aelig;dic
knowledge, such as had been common in the
Middle Ages, and was still fashionable during the
revival of letters, which merely added the element of
classical learning. Like the <i>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</i>
of Francesco Colonna, of which it was doubtless the
prototype, the <i>Alcandros</i> of Filarete, though never
carried beyond the first volume, is an amazing and
wearisome display of the author's arch&aelig;ological learning.
It contains exact descriptions of all the rarities
of ancient art, and of things Oriental which he had
seen, and pages of transcripts from obscure Latin and
Greek authors, descriptive of religious ceremonies;
varied with Platonic philosophy, Decameronian obscenities,
in laboured pseudo-Florentine style, and Dantesque
visions, all held together by the confused narrative of
an allegorical journey performed by the author. It
is profusely ornamented with woodcuts, representing
architectural designs of a fantastic, rather Oriental
description, restorations of ancient buildings, reproductions
of antique inscriptions and designs, and last,
but far from least, a certain number of small compositions,
of Mantegnesque quality, but Botticellian charm,
showing the various adventures of the hero in terrible
woods, delicious gardens, and in the company of nymphs,
demigods, and allegorical personages. These latter are
undoubtedly from the hand of Domenico Neroni; and
it was while discussing these delightful damsels seated
with lutes and psalteries under vine-trellises, these
scholars in cap and gown, weeping in quaint chambers
with canopied beds and carnations growing on the
window, these processions&mdash;suggesting Mantegna's
Triumph of Julius C&aelig;sar&mdash;of priests and priestesses
with victories and trophies, that the painter from
Volterra and the Apulian humanist would discuss the
secret of antique beauty&mdash;discuss it for hours, surrounded
by the precious manuscripts and inscriptions,
the fragments of sculpture, the Eastern rarities, of
Filarete's little house on the Quirinal hill, or among
the box-hedges, clipped cypresses, and fountains of his
garden; while the riots and massacres, the fanatical
processions and feudal wars, of medi&aelig;val Rome raged
unnoticed below. For Pope Sixtus and his Riarios,
and Pope Innocent and his Cybos, thirsting for power
and gold, drunken with lust and bloodshed, were
benign and courteous patrons of all art and all
learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>V</h3>

<p>But that number nine, attained with so much difficulty,
although it put the human proportion into
visible connection with the sun, with beaten gold, the
smell of the heliotrope, and the god Apollo, and opened
a vista of complicated astral influences, did not in
reality bring Domenico one step nearer the object of
his desires. It had enabled those ancient men to make
statues that were perfectly beautiful, that was obvious;
but it did not make his own figures one tittle less
hideous, for he felt them now to be absolutely hideous.
One wintry day, as he was roaming amongst the fallen
pillars and arches, thickly covered with myrtle and
ilex, of the desolate region beyond what had once been
the Forum and was now the cattle-market, there came
across Domenico's mind, while he watched a snake
twisting in the grass, the remembrance of a certain
anecdote about a Greek painter, to whom Hercules had
shown himself in a vision. He had heard it, without
taking any notice, two years before, from the young
scholar who read Cicero at table for Messer Neri
Altoviti; and although he had thought of it several
times, it had never struck him except as one of the
usual impudent displays of learning of the parasitic
tribe of humanists.</p>

<p>But at this moment the remembrance of this fact
came as a great light into Domenico's soul. For what
were these statues save the idols of the heathens; and
what wonder they should be divinely beautiful, when
those who made them might see the gods in visions?</p>

<p>This explanation, which to us must sound far-fetched
and fantastic, knowing, as we do, the real reason that
made a people of athletes into a people of sculptors,
savoured of no strangeness to a man of the Middle
Ages. Visions of superhuman creatures were among
the most undisputed articles of his belief, and among
the commonest subjects of his art. Had not the Blessed
Virgin appeared to St. Bernard, the Saviour among His
cherubim to St. Francis&mdash;the very stones shown at
La Vernia where it had happened&mdash;the Divine Bridegroom
to Catherine of Siena? Had not St. Anthony
of Padua held the Divine Child in his arms? And all
not so long ago? Besides, every year there was some
nun or monk claiming to have conversed with Christ
and His court; and the heavens were opening quite
frequently in the walls of cells and the clefts of hermitages.
And did not Dante relate a journey into Hell,
Purgatory, and Paradise? It was perfectly natural
that what was constantly happening to holy men and
women nowadays should have happened in Pagan times
also; and what men could so well have deserved a visit
from gods as those who spent their lives faithfully
portraying them? The story of Parrhasius and his
vision was familiar ground to a man accustomed to see,
in all corners of Italy, portraits of the Saviour painted
by St. Luke, or finished, like the famous Holy Face of
Lucca, by angels. For an absolute contempt for the
artistic value of such miraculous images did not, in the
mind of Neroni, throw any doubt on their authenticity;
in the same way that the passion for antiquity, the
hankering after Pagan beliefs, did not probably interfere
with the orthodoxy of so many of the humanists.
Domenico, besides, remembered that Virgil and
Ovid, whom he had not read, but whose fables he had
sometimes been asked to illustrate, were constantly
talking of visions of gods and goddesses, nay, of their
descending upon earth to unite themselves with mortals
in love or friendship, for he had had to furnish designs
for woodcuts representing Diana and Endymion, Jupiter
and Ganymede, the gods coming to Philemon and
Baucis, and Apollo tending the herds of Admetus.
Neither did it occur to Domenico's mind that the
existence of the old gods might be a mere invention, or
a mere delusion of the heathen. For all their classic
culture, the men of the fifteenth century, as the men of
the thirteenth for all their scholasticism, were in an
intellectual condition such as we rarely meet with
nowadays among educated persons; and Domenico, a
mere handicraftsman, had not learned from the study
of Cicero and Plato to examine and understand the
difference between reality and fiction. To him a scene
which was frequently painted, an adventure which
was written down and could be read, was necessarily a
reality. Dante had spoken of the gods, and what
Dante said was evidently true, the allegorical meaning,
the metaphor, entirely escaping this simple mind; and
Virgil, Homer, Ovid told the most minute details
about gods and goddesses, and they themselves were
grave and learned men. Domenico did not even think
that the ancient gods were dead. Of course heaven
was now occupied by Christ and His saints, those
heavenly hosts of whom he would think, when he
thought of them at all, as seated stepwise on a great
stand, blue and pink and green in dress, golden discs
about their heads, and an atmosphere of fretted gold,
of swirling stencilled golden angels' wings all round
them, and God the Father, a great triangle blazing
with Alpha and Omega, above Jesus enthroned, and
His mother; and it was they who ruled things here,
and to them he said his prayers night and morning,
and knelt in church. But <i>here</i>, somehow did not
cover the whole universe, nor did that pink and blue
and gold miniature painter's heaven extend everywhere,
although, of course, somehow or other it did.
Anyhow, it was certain that not so very far off there
were Saracens and Turks&mdash;why he had seen some of
the Duke of Calabria's Turkish garrison&mdash;who believed
in Macomet, Trevigant, and Apollinis; these to be sure
were false gods (the word <i>false</i> carried no clear meaning
to his mind, or if any, one rather equivalent to
<i>wrong, objectionable</i> rather than to non-existent), but they
certainly worked wonderful miracles for their people.
And indeed&mdash;here Domenico's placid contemplation of
the kingdom of Macomet, Trevigant, and Apollinis was
exchanged for a vague horror, shot with gleams of
curiosity&mdash;the devil also had his place in the world, a
place much nearer and universal, and did marvellous
things, pointing out treasures, teaching the future,
lending invulnerable strength to the men and women
who worshipped him, of whom some might be pointed
out to you in every town&mdash;yes, grave and respectable
men, priests and monks among them, and even Cardinals
of Holy Church, as every one knew quite well&hellip;. So
that, in a confused manner, rather negative
than positive, Domenico considered that the Pagan
gods must be somewhere or other, the past and present
not very clearly separated in his mind, or rather the
past existing in a peculiar simultaneous manner with
the present, as a sort of St. Brandan's isle, in distant,
unattainable seas; or as Dante's mountain of
Purgatory, a very solid mountain indeed, yet which,
for some mysterious and unquestioned reason, people
never stumbled upon except after death. All this
was scarcely an actual series of arguments; it was
rather the arguments which, with much effort, Domenico
might have fished out of his obscure consciousness
had you summoned him to explain how the
ancient gods could possibly be immortal. As to him,
he had always heard of them as immortal, and
although he had not been taught any respect or love
for them as for Christ, the Madonna, and the saints,
they must be existing somewhere since <i>immortal</i> means
that which cannot die.</p>

<p>But now he began to feel a certain shyness about
immortal gods, for they had begun to occupy his
thoughts, and it was with much cunning that he put
questions to his friend Filarete, desirous to gain information
on certain points without actually seeming to
ask it. The humanist, summoned to explain what the
Fathers of the Church&mdash;those worthies crowned with
mitres and offering rolls of manuscript, whom Domenico
had occasionally to portray for his customers&mdash;said
about the ancient gods, answered with much
glibness but considerable contempt, for the Greek and
Latin of these saintly philosophers inspired the learned
man with a feeling of nausea. He got out of a chest
several volumes covered with dust, and began to quote
the "Apology" of Justin Martyr, the "Legation" of
Athenagoras, the "Apology" of Tertullian and Lactantius,
whose very name caused him to writhe with
philological loathing. And he told Domenico that it
was the opinion of these holy but ill-educated persons
that d&aelig;mons assumed the name and attributes of Jupiter,
of Venus, of Apollo and Bacchus, lurking in temples, instituting
festivals and sacrifices, and were often allowed
by Heaven to distract the faithful by a display of miracles.</p>

<p>"Then they are devils?" asked Domenico, trying to
follow.</p>

<p>A smile passed over the beautifully cut mouth, the
noble, wrinkled face&mdash;like that of the marble Seneca&mdash;of
the old humanist.</p>

<p>"Talk of devils to the barefoot friar who preaches
in the midst of the market-place," he said, "not to
Filarete. The whole world, air, fire, earth, water, the
entire universe is governed by d&aelig;mons, and they inspire
our noblest thoughts. Hast never heard of the
familiar d&aelig;mon of Socrates, whispering to him superhuman
wisdom? Yes, indeed, Venus, Apollo, &AElig;sculapius,
Jove, the stars and planets, the winds and tides
are d&aelig;mons. But thou canst not understand such
matters, my poor Domenico. So get thee to Brother
Baldassare of Palermo, and ask him questions."</p>

<p>But Filarete's expression was very different when,
one day, Domenico shyly inquired concerning the
truth of that story of Parrhasius and the Hercules of
Lindos. Strange rumours were current in Rome of
unholy festivities in which Filarete and other learned
men&mdash;some of those whom Paul II. had thrown into
prison&mdash;had once taken part. They had not merely
laid their tables and spread their couches according
to descriptions contained in ancient authors; but,
crowned with roses, laurel, myrtle, or parsley, had sung
hymns to the heathen gods, and, it was whispered,
poured out libations and burned incense in their honour.
Their friends, indeed, had answered scornfully
that these were but amusements of learned men; not
to be taken more seriously than the invocations to the
gods and muses in their poems, than the mythological
subjects which the Popes themselves selected to adorn
their dwellings. And doubtless this explanation was
correct. Yet the pleasure of these little pedantic and
artistic mummeries, which took place in suburban
gardens, while the townsfolk streamed in the hot June
nights, decked with bunches of cloves and of lavender,
to make bonfires in the empty places near the Lateran,
little guessing that their ancestors had once done the
same in honour of the neighbouring Venus&mdash;the innocent
childishness of these learned men was perhaps
spiced, for some individuals at least, by a momentary
belief in the gods of the old poets, by a sudden forbidden
fervour for the exiled divinities of Virgil and Ovid,
under whose reign the world had been young, men had
been free to love and think, and Rome, now the object
of the world's horror and contempt, had been the
world's triumphant mistress. But these had been mere
mummeries, mere child's play, and the soul of Filarete
had thirsted for a reality. He could not have answered
had you asked whether he believed in the absolute
existence and power of the old gods, any more than
whether he disbelieved in the power of Christ and His
avenging angels; his cultivated and sceptical mind was,
after all, in a state of disorder similar to that of
Domenico's ignorance. All that he knew with certainty
was that Christ and His worship represented to
him all that was unnatural, cruel, foolish, and hypocritical;
while the gods were associated with every
thought of liberty, of beauty, and of glory. And so,
one evening, after working up still further the enthusiasm,
the passionate desire of his friend, he told Domenico
that, if he chose, he too perhaps might see a god.</p>

<p>In his antiquarian rambles Filarete had discovered,
a mile or two outside the southern gates of Rome, a
subterranean chamber, richly adorned with stuccoes&mdash;known
nowadays as the tomb of certain members of
the Flavian family, but which, thanks to the defective
knowledge of his day and the habit of seeing people
buried in churches, the humanist had mistaken for
a temple&mdash;intact, and scarcely desecrated, of the
Eleusinian Bacchus. Above its vaults, barely indicated
by a higher mound in the waving ground of the
pasture land, had once stood a Christian church, as
ancient almost as the supposed temple below, whose
Byzantine columns lay half hidden by the high grass,
and the walls of whose apse had become overgrown by
ivy and weeds, the nest of lazy snakes. The Gothic
soldiers, Arians or heathens, who had burned down, in
some drunken bout, the little church above-ground,
had penetrated at the same time into the tomb beneath
in search of treasure, and finding none, dispersed the
bones in the sarcophagi they had opened. They had
left open the aperture leading downward, which had
been matted over by a thick growth of ivy and wild
clematis. One day, while surveying the remains of
the Christian church, always in hopes of discovering in
it a former temple of the Pagans, Filarete had walked
into that tuft of solid green, and found himself, buried
and half stunned, in the mouth of the tomb below. It
was through this that he bade Domenico follow him,
bearing a certain mysterious package in his cloak, one
January day of the year fourteen hundred and eighty-eight.</p>

<p>Above-ground it had frozen in the night; here
below, when they had descended the rugged sepulchral
stairs, the air had a damp warmth, an odd feel of
inhabitation. Above-ground, also, everything lay in
ruins, while here all was intact. As the light of the
torches moved slowly along the vaulted and stuccoed
ceilings, it showed the delicate lines of a profusion of
little reliefs and ornaments, fresh as if cast and coloured
yesterday. Slender garlands of leaves, and long knotted
ribbons and veils in lowest relief partitioned the space;
and framed by them, now round, now oval, now oblong,
were medallions of naked gods banqueting and playing
games, of satyrs and nymphs dancing, nereids swinging
on the backs of hippocamps, tritons curling their tails
and blowing their horns, Cupids fluttering among
griffins and chim&aelig;ras; a life of laughter and love,
which mocked the eye, starting into vividness in one
place, dying away in a mere film where the torchlight
pressed on too closely in others. All along the walls,
below the line of the stuccoes, were excavated shelves,
on which stood numbers of small cinerary boxes, each
bearing a name. In the middle of the vaulted chamber
was a huge stone coffin, carved with revelling Bacchantes,
and grim tragic masks at its corners; and all round the
coffin, broken in one of its flanks by the tools of the
treasure-seeker, lay bones and skulls, dispersed on the
damp ground even as the Goths had left them.</p>

<p>It was this sarcophagus which, with its Dionysiac
revels, and the name of one Dionysius carved on it, a
freedman of the Flavians, had led Filarete to consider
the tomb as a kind of temple consecrated to Bacchus.</p>

<p>Filarete bade Domenico stick the pointed end of
his torch into the mouth of an amphora standing erect
in a corner, and began to unpack the load they had
brought on a mule. It looked like the preparation for
a feast: there were loaves of bread, fruit, a flask of
choice wine; and Domenico, for a moment, thought
the old man mad. But his feelings changed when
Filarete produced a set of silver lamps, and bade him
trim and light them, placing them on the ledges alongside
of the cinerary urns; and when he lit some strange
incense and filled the place with its smoke. Despite
the many descriptions of ancient sacrifices with which
the humanist had entertained him, Domenico had
brought a vague notion of a raising of devils, and felt
relieved at the absence of brimstone fumes, and of the
magic books that accompanied them.</p>

<p>Although more passionately longing&mdash;he knew not,
he dared not tell himself for what&mdash;Domenico did not
come with the curious exaltation of spirits of his
companion, all whose antiquarian lore had gone to his
head, and who really imagined himself to be a genuine
Pagan engaged in Pagan rites. For Filarete the ceremony
was everything; for Domenico it was merely
a means, a sort of sacrilegious juggling, into which he
had not inquired more particularly, which was to give
him the object of his wishes at the price of great peril
to his soul. But when the subterranean chamber was
filled with a cloud of incense, through which, in the
dim yellow light of the lamp, the naked gods and
goddesses on the vault, the satyrs and nymphs, the
Tritons and Bacchantes seemed to float in and out of
sight, a feeling of awe, of an unknown kind of reverence
and rapture, began to fill his soul, and his eyes
became fixed on the lid of the carved sarcophagus&mdash;vague
images of Christian resurrections mingling with
his hopes&mdash;Would the god appear?</p>

<p>Filarete, meanwhile, had enveloped his head in a
long linen veil, and, after washing his hands thrice in
a golden basin brought for the purpose, he placed some
faggots on the sarcophagus, lit them, and throwing
grains of incense and of salt alternately into the
flames, began to chant in an unknown tongue, which
Domenico guessed to be Greek. Then beckoning to
the painter, who was kneeling, as at church, in a
corner, he bade him unpack a basket matted over
with leaves, whose movements and sounds had puzzled
Domenico as he carried it down. In great surprise,
and with a vague sense of he knew not what, he handed
its contents to Filarete. It was a miserable little
lamb, newly born, its long, soft legs tied together, its
almost sightless, pale eyes half-started from its sockets.
As the humanist took it, it bleated with sudden shrill
strength, and Domenico could not help thinking of
certain images he had seen on monastery walls of the
Good Shepherd carrying the lame lamb on his shoulders.
This was very different. For, with an odd ferocity,
Filarete placed the miserable young creature on the
stone before the fire, and slit its throat and chest with
a long knife.</p>

<p>The god did not appear. They extinguished the
lamps, left the carcase of the lamb half charred in a
pool of blood on the stone, and slowly reascended into
the daylight, leaving behind them, in the vaulted
chamber, a stifling fume of incense, of burnt flesh, and
mingled damp.</p>

<p>Up above, among the ruins of the Christian church,
where they had left their mules, it was cold and sunny,
and the light seemed curiously blue, almost grey and
dusty, after the yellow illumination below. Before
them, interrupted here and there by a mass of ruined
masonry, or a few arches of aqueduct, waved the grey-green,
billowy plain, where the wind, which rolled the
great winter cloud-balls overhead, danced and sang
with the tall, dry hemlocks and sere white thistles,
shining and rattling like skeletons. And on to it seemed
to descend cloud-mountains, vague blueness and darkness&mdash;cloud
or hill, you could not tell which&mdash;out of
whose flank, ever and anon, a sunbeam conjured up a
visionary white resplendent city.</p>

<p>The short winter day was beginning to draw in
when they approached silently the city walls, solemn
with their towers and gates, endless as it seemed, and
enclosing, one felt vaguely, an endless, distant, invisible
city.</p>

<p>The sound of its bells came as from afar to meet the
sacrilegious men.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The culminating sacrilege was yet to come. The
place that witnessed it remains unchanged&mdash;a half-deserted
church among the silent grass-grown lanes,
the crumbling convent walls, and ill-tended vineyards
of the Aventine; a hill that has retained in Christian
times a look of its sinister fame in Pagan ones. Among
the cypresses, which seem to wander up the hillside,
rises the square belfry, among whose brickwork, flushed
in the sunset, are inlaid discs of porphyry torn from
some temple pavement, and plates of green majolica
brought from the East, it is said, by pilgrims or
Crusaders. The arum-fringed lane widens before the
outer wall of the church, overtopped by its triangular
gable. Behind this wall is a yard or atrium, the pavement
grass-grown, the walls stained with great patches
of mildew, and showing here and there in their dilapidation
the shaft and capital of a bricked-up Ionic
pillar. The place tells of centuries of neglect, of the
gradual invasion of resistless fever; and it was fitly
chosen, some fifty years ago, for the abode of a community
of Trappists. In the reign of Innocent VIII. it was
still nominally in the hands of certain Cistercians; but
the fever had long driven these monks to the more
wholesome end of the hill, where they had erected a
smaller church; and the convent had served for years
as a fortress of the turbulent family of the Capranicas,
one of whose members was always the nominal abbot,
with the Cardinal's hat, and title Jervase and Protasius.
And now, at the end of the fifteenth century,
a Cardinal Ascanio Capranica, famous for his struggle
in magnificence and sinfulness with the magnificent
and sinful young nephews of Pope Sixtus, had determined
to restore the fortified monastery, to combat
the fever by abundant plantations, and to make the
church a monument of his splendour. And, in order
to secure some benefit by his own munificence, he had
begun by commissioning Domenico Neroni to design
and execute a sepulchre three storeys high, full of
carvings, and covered with statues, so that his soul,
if sent untimely to heaven, might not be dishonoured
by the unworthy resting-place of its trusty companion,
the Cardinal's handsome and well-tended body.</p>

<p>This church of SS. Jervase and Protasius, which
imitated, like most churches of the early Christian
period, the form of a basilica or court of law, was constructed
out of fragments of Pagan edifices, and occupied
the site of a Pagan edifice, whose columns had
been employed to carry the roof of the church, or, when
of porphyry or serpentine, had been sawed into discs
for the pavement. On the slant of the hill, supporting
the apse, encircled by pillarets, is a round mass of
masonry, overgrown with ivy and ilex scrub, the remains
of some antique bath or grotto; and under the battlemented
walls, the cloistered courts of the convent, there
stretches, it is said, a network of subterranean passages
running down to the Tiber. Four hundred years ago
they were not to be discovered if looked for, being
completely hidden by the fallen masonry and the
cypress roots and growths of poisonous plants&mdash;nightshade,
and hemlock, and green-flowered hellebore; but
wicked monks had sometimes been sucked into them
while digging the ground, or decoyed into their labyrinths
by devils. Was it possible that there had
lingered on through the ages a vague and horrified
remembrance of those rites, the discovery of whose
mysterious and wide-spread abominations had frozen
Rome with horror in her most high and palmy days;
and was there a connection between those neophytes,
wandering with blood-stained limbs and dishevelled
locks among the groves of the Aventine, then rushing
to quench their burning torches in the Tiber, two
centuries before Christ, and the devils who troubled
the Benedictines of SS. Jervase and Protasius? These
evil spirits would appear, it had been said, in the
cloisters of the convent, processions carrying lights
and garlands; and on certain nights, when the monks
were in prayer in their cells, strange sounds would
issue from the church itself, of flutes and timbrels, and
demon laughter, and demon voices chanting some
unknown litany, and clearly aping the mass; and Cardinal
Capranica was blamed by many pious persons for
his rash intention of filling once more the deserted
convent, and exposing holy men to the wrath of such
very pertinacious devils. Meanwhile mass upon mass
was said to clear the place of this demoniac infection.
It was in this church that the sacrilege of Domenico
and Filarete rose to its highest, and that an event took
place which the men of the fifteenth century could
scarce find words to designate.</p>

<p>Domenico had grown tired of his friend's arch&aelig;ological
impieties. It gave him no satisfaction to pour
out wine, burn incense, arrange garlands, and even cut
the throats of animals according to a correct Pagan
ritual. It was nothing to him that Horace and Ovid
and Tibullus should have done alike. He was a good
Christian, never doubting for a moment the power of
the Blessed Virgin, the saints, and even the smallest
and meanest priest, nor the heat of hell-fire. But he
wanted to have the secret of antique proportions, and
he was convinced that this secret could be communicated
only by a Pagan divinity, just as certain theological
mysteries, such as the use of the rosary, had been
revealed to the saints by Christ or the Virgin. The
Pagan gods were devils, and to hold communication
with devils was mortal sin and sure damnation. But
lots of people communicated with devils for much more
paltry motives, for greed of gold or love of woman,
and were yet saved by the intercession of some heavenly
patron, or found it worth while not to be saved at all.
Domenico, like them, put the question of salvation
behind him. He might think of that afterwards, when
he had possessed himself of the proportion of the
ancients. At all events, at present he was willing to
risk everything in order to attain that. He was determined
to see that god of the heathens, not as he had
seen him once in the house of Messer Neri Altoviti,
cut out of marble, but alive, moving, speaking; for <i>that</i>
was the god.</p>

<p>The god was a devil. Now it is well known that
there is a way of compelling every devil to show himself,
providing you use sufficiently strong spells. They
had sacrificed goats and lambs enough, also doves, and
had burned perfumes, and spilt wine sufficient for one
of Cardinal Riario's suppers. It was evidently not
that sort of sacrifice which would rejoice the god or
compel him to show himself. For weeks and weeks
Domenico ruminated over the subject. And little by
little the logical, inevitable answer dawned upon his
horrified but determined mind. For what was the
sacrifice which witches and warlocks notoriously offered
their Master?</p>

<p>The place could not be better chosen. This church
was full, every one knew, of demons, who were certainly
none other than the gods of the heathen, as Tertullian,
Lactantius, Athenagoras, Justin Martyr, and all those
other holy doctors had written. It was deserted, its
keys in the hands of Cardinal Capranica's confidential
architect and decorator; and there were masses being
said every holiday to scare the evil spirits. The sacrament
was frequently left on the altar.</p>

<p>All this Domenico expounded frequently to Filarete.
But Filarete's classic taste did not approve of Domenico's
methods, which savoured of vulgar witchcraft; perhaps
also the learned man, who did not want the secret of
antique proportion, recoiled from a degree of profanity
and of danger, both to body and soul, which his companion
willingly incurred in such a quest as his. So
Filarete demurred for a time, until at length his feebler
nature took fire at Domenico's determination, and the
guilty pair fixed upon the day and place for this
unspeakable sacrilege.</p>

<p>The Church of SS. Jervase and Protasius has undergone
no change since the feast of Corpus Christi of the
year 1488. The damp that lies in the atrium outside,
making the grass and poppies sprout round the Byzantine
pillar which carries a cross over a pine-cone, has
invaded the flat-roofed nave and the wide aisles, separated
from it by a single colonnade. A greenish mildew
marks the fissures in the walls, rent here and there
by landslips and earthquakes. The cipolline columns
carrying the round arches on their square capitals are
lustreless, and their green-veined marble looks like
long-buried wood. The mosaic pavement stretches its
discs and volutes of porphyry and serpentine or yellowed
Parian marble, a tarnished and uneven carpet, to the
greenish-white marble steps of the chancel. The
mosaics have long fallen out of the circle of the apse;
and the frescoes, painted by some obscure follower of
Giotto, have left only a green vague stain over the
arches of the aisle. Pictures or statues there are none,
and no conspicuous sepulchre. Only, over the low
entrance, a colossal wooden crucifix of the thirteenth
century hangs at an angle from the wall, a painted
Christ, stretching his writhing livid limbs in agony
opposite the high altar. It was in this stately and
desolate church, under the misty light that pours in
through the wide windows of grey coarse glass, and
on the marble altar, facing that effigy of the dying
Saviour, that, in derision as it were of the miracle which
the church commemorates on that feast-day, Domenico
and Filarete were about to offer up to the demons
Apollo, Bacchus, and Jove the freshly consecrated
wafer, the very body and blood of Christ.</p>

<p>But an accomplice of theirs, a certain monk well
versed in magic, whom they employed in sundry details
of devil-raising, on the score that they were seeking
treasure hidden in the church, had suddenly been seized
with qualms of conscience. Instead of appearing at
the appointed time alone, and bearing certain necessaries
of his art, he kept them waiting a full hour, until
they began their proceedings without his assistance.
And even as Domenico was reaching his companion
the ostensorium, which had remained on the altar after
the morning's mass, the church was surrounded by the
officers of the Podest&agrave;, on horseback, and by a crowd of
monks and priests, and rabble who had followed them.
Of these persons, not a few affirmed in after years, that,
as they arrived at the church door, they had heard
sounds of flutes and timbrels, and mocking songs filling
the place; and that the devil, dressed in skins and garlands
like a wild man of the woods, had cleft the roof
with his head, and disappeared with many blasphemous
yells as they entered.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>VII</h3>

<p>In those last years of the fifteenth century, Rome
was a city of the Middle Ages. The cupola of the
Pantheon, the circular hulk of the Colosseum, and the
twin columns of Trajan and Antoninus projected, like
the fantastic antiquities of some fresco of Benozzo
Gozzoli, above domeless church roofs, battlemented
palace walls, and innumerable Gothic belfries and
feudal towers. In the theatre of Marcellus rose the
fortress of the Orsinis; against the tower whence Nero,
as the legend ran, had watched the city burning, were
clustered the fortifications of the Colonnas; and in
every quarter the stern palaces of their respective
partisans frowned with their rough-hewn fronts, their
holes for barricade beams, and hooks for chains. The
bridge of St. Angelo was covered with the shops of
armourers, as the old bridge of more peaceful Florence
with those of silversmiths. Walls and towers encircled
the Leonine City where the Pope sat unquietly in the
big battlemented donjon by the Sixtine Chapel; and in
its midst was still old St. Peter's, half Lombard, half
Byzantine. In Rome there was no industry, no order,
no safety. Through its gates rushed raids of Colonnas
and Orsinis, sold to or betrayed by the Popes, from
their castles of Umbria or the Campagna to their castles
in town; and their feuds meant battles also between
the citizens who obeyed or thwarted them. Houses
were sacked and burnt, and occasionally razed to the
ground, for the ploughshare and the salt-sower to go
over their site. A few years later, when Pope Borgia
dredged the Tiber for the body of his son, the boatmen
of Ripetta reported that so many bodies were thrown
over every night that they no longer heeded such occurrences.
And when, two centuries later, the Corsinis
dug the foundations of their house on the Longara,
there were discovered quantities of human bones in
what had been the palace of Pope della Rovere's
nephew. Meanwhile Ghirlandaio and Perugino were
painting the walls of the Sixtine; Pinturicchio was
designing the blue and gold allegorical ceilings of the
library; Bramante building the Chancellor's palace,
and the Pollaiolas and Mino da Fiesole carving the
tombs in St. Peter's, while learned men translated Plato
and imitated Horace.</p>

<p>Of this Rome there remains nowadays nothing, or
next to nothing. Sometimes, indeed, looking up the
green lichened sides of some medi&aelig;val tower, with its
hooks for chains, and its holes for beams, a vague vision
thereof rises in our mind. And in the presence of
certain groups by Signorelli, representing murderous
scuffles or supernatural destruction, we feel as if we
had come in contact with the other reality of those
times, the thing which serene art and literature and
the love of antiquity have driven into the background.
But the complete vision of the time and place, the certain
knowledge of that Rome of Sixtus IV. and Innocent
VIII., we can now no longer grasp, a dreadful phantom
passing too rapidly across the centuries.</p>

<p>It is with this feeling of impotence in my attempt
to follow the thoughts of an illiterate artist of the Renaissance,
that I prefer to conclude this strange story
of the quest after antique beauty and antique gods by
quoting a page from one of the barbarous chroniclers
of medi&aelig;val Rome. The entry in the continuation of
Infessura's diary is headed "Pictor Sacrilegus":&mdash;</p>

<p>"On the 20th July of the year of salvation fourteen
hundred and eighty-eight, there were placed for three
days in a cage on high in the Campo dei Fiori, Messer
Niccol&ograve; Filarete, Canon of Sancto Joanne; also Domenico,
the Volterran, painter and architect to the magnificent
Cardinal Ascanio, and Frate Garofalo of Valmontone,
they having been discovered in the act of desecrating
the Church of SS. Jervase and Protasius, and stealing
for magic purposes the ostensorium and many gold
chalices and reliquaries with precious stones; and it
was Frate Garofalo who, being versed in witchcraft
and treasure finding, was the accomplice of the above,
and denounced them on the feast of Corpus Domini.
And the twenty-third of the said month of July they
were justiced, and in this manner. <i>Videlicet</i>, Filarete
and Domenico, having been removed from the cage,
were dragged on hurdles as far as the square of San
Joanni, and Frate Garofalo went on an ass, all of
them crowned with paper mitres. Frate Garofalo was
hanged to the elm-tree of the square. Of Filarete and
Domenico, the right hand was chopped off, after which
they were burned in the said square. And their
chopped off right hands were taken to the Capitol and
nailed up above the gate, alongside of the She-wolf of
metal. Laus Deo."</p>

<h3><a name="VALEDICTORY" id="VALEDICTORY"></a>VALEDICTORY</h3>
<h3>I</h3>

<p>While gathering together the foregoing pages, written
at different periods and in different phases of thought,
the knowledge has grown on me that I was saying
farewell to some of the ambitions and to most of the
plans of my youth.</p>

<p>All writers start with the hope of solving a problem
or establishing a formula, however fragmentary or
humble; and many, the most fortunate, and probably
the most useful, continue to work out their program,
or at least to think that they do so. Life to them is
but the framework for work; and that is why they
manage to leave a fair amount of work behind them,&mdash;work
for other workers to employ or to undo. But
with some persons, life somehow gets the better of
work, becomes, whether in the form of circumstance or
of new problems, infinitely the stronger; and scatters
work, tossing about such fragments as itself, in its
irregular, irresistible fashion, has torn into insignificance,
or (once in a blue moon!) shaped into more
complete meaning.</p>

<p>As regards my own case, I began by believing I
should be an historian and a philosopher, as most
young people have done before me; then, coming in
contact with the concrete miseries of others, called
social and similar problems, I sought to apply some
of my historical or philosophic lore (such as it was)
to their removal; and finally, life having manifested
itself as offering problems (unexpected occurrence!)
not merely concerning the Past, nor even the abstract
Present, but respecting my own comfort and discomfort,
I have found myself at last wondering in what
manner thoughts and impressions could make the
world, the Past and Present, the near and the remote,
more satisfying and useful to myself. Circumstances
of various kinds, and particularly ill-health, have thus
put me, although a writer, into the position of a
reader; and have made me ask myself, as I collected
these fragments of my former studies, what can the
study of history, particularly of the history of art and
of other manifestations of past conditions of soul, do
for us in the present?</p>

<p>All knowledge is bound to be useful. Apart from
this truism, I believe that all study of past conditions
and activities will eventually result, if not in the
better management of present conditions and activities
(as all partisan historians have hoped, from Machiavelli
to Macaulay), at all events in a greater familiarity
with the various kinds of character expressed in historical
events and in the way of looking at them; for
even if we cannot learn to guide and employ such
multifold forces as make, for instance, a French revolution,
we may learn to use for the best the individual
minds and temperaments of those who describe them:
a Carlyle, a Michelet, a Taine, are natural forces also,
which may serve or may damage us.</p>

<p>Moreover, I hold by the belief, expressed years ago,
in my previous volume of Renaissance studies, to wit,
that historical reading (and in historical I include the
history of thoughts and feelings as much as of events and
persons) is a useful exercise for our sympathies, bringing
us wider and more wholesome notions of justice and
charity. And I feel sure that other uses for historical
studies could be pointed out by other persons, apart
from the satisfaction they afford to those who pursue
them, which, considered merely as so much spiritual
gymnastics, or cricket, or football, or alpineering, is
surely not to be despised.</p>

<p>But now, having dropped long since out of the ranks
of those who study in order to benefit others, or even
to benefit only themselves, I would say a few words
about the advantage which mere readers, as distinguished
from writers, may get from familiarity with
the Past.</p>

<p>This advantage is that they may find in the Past
not merely a fine field for solitary and useless delusions
(though that also seems necessary), but an additional
world for real companionship and congenial activity.
Our individual activities and needs of this kind are
innumerable, and of infinite delicate variety; and there
is reason to suppose that the place in which our lot is
cast does not necessarily fit them to perfection. For
things in this world are very roughly averaged; and
although averaging is a useful, rapid way of despatching
business, it does undoubtedly waste a great deal
which is too good for wasting. Hence, it seems to me,
the need which many of us feel, which most of us
would feel, if secured of food and shelter, of spending
a portion of their life of the spirit in places and
climates beyond that River Oceanus which bounds the
land of the living.</p>

<p>As I write these words, I am conscious that this
will strike many readers as the expression of a superfine
and selfish dilettantism, arising no doubt from
morbid lack of sympathy with the world into which
Heaven has put us. What! become absentees from
the poor, much troubled Present; turn your backs to
Realities, become idle strollers in the Past? And why
not, dear friends? why not recognise the need for a
holiday? why not admit, just because work has to be
done and loads to be borne, that we cannot grind and
pant on without interruption? Nay, that the bearing
of the load, the grinding of the work, is useless save to
diminish the total grinding and panting on this earth.
Moreover, I maintain that we have but a narrow conception
of life if we confine it to the functions which
are obviously practical, and a narrow conception of
reality if we exclude from it the Past. And not because
the Past has been, has actually existed outside some one,
but because it may, and often does, actually exist within
ourselves. The things in our mind, due to the mind's
constitution and its relation with the universe, are,
after all, realities; and realities to count with, as much
as the tables and chairs, and hats and coats, and other
things subject to gravitation outside it. It would
seem, indeed, as if the chief outcome of the spiritualising
philosophy which maintains the immaterial and
independent quality of mind had been to make mind,
the contents of our consciousness, ideas, images, and
feelings, into something quite separate from this real
material universe, and hence unworthy of practical
consideration. But granted that mind is not a sort of
independent and foreign entity, we must admit that
what exists in it has a place in reality, and requires,
like the rest of reality, to be dealt with. But to
return to my thesis: that we require occasionally to
live in the Past (and I shall go on to state that it may
be a Past of our own making); Do we not require to
travel in foreign parts which know us not, to sojourn
for our welfare in cities where we can neither elect
members nor exercise professions, but whence we bring
back, not merely wider views, but sounder nerves,
tempers more serene and elastic? Nor is this all. We
think poorly of a man or woman who, besides practical
cases for self or others, does not require to come in
contact also with the tangible, breathable, visible,
audible universe for its own sake; require to wander in
fields and on moors, to steep in sunshine or be battered
by winds, for the sake of a certain specific emotion of
participation in, of closer union with, the universal.
Now the Past&mdash;the joys and sufferings of the men long
dead, their efforts, ideals, emotions, nay, their very
sensations and temperaments as registered in words or
expressed in art, are but another side of the universe,
of that universal life, to participate ever deeper in
which is the condition of our strength and serenity,
the imperious necessity of our ever giving, ever taking
soul.</p>

<p>And so, for our greater nobility and happiness, we
require, all of us, to live to some extent in the Past, as
to live to some extent in what we significantly call
<i>nature</i>. We require, as we require mountain air or sea
scents, hayfields or wintry fallows, sun, storm, or rain,
each individual according to individual subtle affinities,
certain emotions, ideals, persons, or works of art from
out of the Past. For one it will be Socrates; for another
St. Francis; for every one something somewhat
different, or at all events something differently conceived
and differently felt: some portion of the universe
in time, as of the universe in space, which answers in
closest and most intimate way to the complexion and
habits of that individual soul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>II</h3>

<p>The satisfaction which it can bring to every individual
soul: this is, therefore, one of the uses of the Past to
the Present, and surely not one of the smallest. It is,
I venture to insist, the special, the essential use of all
art and all poetry; any additional knowledge of Nature's
proceedings, any additional discipline of thought and
observation which may accrue in the study of art as
an historic or psychological phenomenon being, after
all, valuable eventually for the amount of such mere
satisfaction of the spirit as that additional knowledge
or additional discipline can conduce towards. Scientific
results are important for the maintenance of life,
doubtless; but the sense of satisfaction, whether simple
or complex, high or low, is the sign that the processes
we call life are being fulfilled and not thwarted; so,
since satisfaction is no such contemptible thing, why
not allow art to furnish it unmixed?</p>

<p>I am sure to be misunderstood. I do not in the least
mean to imply that art can best be appreciated with
the least trouble. The mere fact that the pleasure of
a faculty is proportioned to its activity negatives that;
and the fact that the richness, fulness, and hence
also the durability, of all artistic pleasure answers
to the amount of our attention: the mine, the ore,
will yield, other things equal, according as we dig, and
wash, and smelt, and separate to the last possibility
of separation what we want from what we do not
want.</p>

<p>The historic or psychological study of art does thus
undoubtedly increase our familiarity, and hence our
enjoyment. The mere scientific inquiry into the difference
between originals and copies, into the connection
between master and pupil, makes us alive to the special
qualities which can delight us. As long as we looked in
a manner so slovenly that a spurious Botticelli could
pass for a genuine one, we could evidently never benefit
by the special quality, the additional excellence of
Botticelli's own work. And similarly in the case of
arch&aelig;ology. Indeed, in the few cases where I have
myself hazarded an hypothesis on some point of artistic
history, as, for instance, regarding the respective origin
of antique and medi&aelig;val sculpture, I am inclined to
think that the chief use (if any at all) of my work, will
be to make my readers more sensitive to the specific
pleasure they may get from Praxiteles or from Mino
da Fiesole, than they could have been when the works
of both were so little understood as to be judged by
one another's standards.</p>

<p>But to return. It seems as if at present the development,
the contagion, so to speak, of scientific methods
applied to art were making people forget a little that
art, besides being, like everything else, the passive
object of scientific treatment, is (what most other things
are not) an active, positive, special factor of pleasure;
and that, therefore, save to special students, the greater,
more efficacious form of art should occupy an immensely
larger share of attention than the lesser and
more inefficient. We are made, nowadays, to look at
too much mediocre art on the score of its historical
value; we are kept too long in contemplation of pictures
and statues which cannot give much pleasure,
on the score that they led to or proceeded from other
pictures or statues which can.</p>

<p>As regards Greek sculpture, the insistance on archaic
forms is becoming, if I may express my own feelings,
a perfect bore. Why should we be kept in the kitchen
tasting half-cooked stuff out of ladles, when most of us
have barely time to eat our fully cooked dinner, which
we like and thrive on, in peace? Similarly with such
painters as are mainly precursors. They are taking
up too much of our attention; and one might sometimes
be tempted to think that the only use of great
artists, like the only functions of those patriarchs
who kept begetting one another, was to produce other
great artists: Giotto to produce eventually Masaccio,
Masaccio through various generations Michelangelo and
Raphael, and Michelangelo and Raphael, through even
more, Manet and Degas, who in their turn doubtless
dutifully&hellip;. Meanwhile why should art have gone
on evolving, artists gone on making <i>filiations of schools</i>,
if art, if artists, if schools of artists had not answered
an imperious, undying wish for the special pleasures
which painting can give?</p>

<p>Therefore it seems to me that, desirable for all reasons
as may be the study of art, the knowledge of <i>filiations
and influences</i>, it is still more desirable that each of us
should find out some painter whom he can care for individually;
and that all of us should find out certain
painters who can, almost infallibly, give immense pleasure
to all of us; painters who, had they been produced
out of nothingness and been followed by nobody,
would yet stand in the most important relation in
which an artist can be: the relation of being beloved
by the whole world, or even by a few solitary individuals.</p>

<p>For this reason let not the mere reader, who comes to
art not for work, but for refreshment, let not the mere
reader (I call him reader, to note his passive, leisurely
character) be vexed with too much study of Florentine
and Paduan <i>precursors</i>, but go straight to the masters,
whom those useful and dreary persons rendered possible
by their grinding. Our ancestors, or rather those cardinals
and superb lords with whom we have neither
spiritual nor temporal relationship, who made the great
collections of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
placing statues under delicate colonnades and green
ilex hedges, and hanging pictures in oak-panelled corridors
and tapestried guard-rooms, were occasionally
mistaken in thinking that a Roman emperor much
restored, or a chalky, sprawling Guido Reni, could afford
lasting &aelig;sthetic pleasure; but, bating such errors,
were they not nearer good sense than we moderns, who
arrange pictures and statues as we might minerals or
herbs in a museum, and who, for instance, insist that
poor tired people, longing for a little beauty, should
carefully examine the works of Castagno, of Rosselli,
and of that artist, so interesting as a specimen of the
minimum of talent, Neri di Bicci? They were unscientific,
those lords and cardinals, and desperately
pleasure-seeking; but surely, surely they were more
sensible than we.</p>

<p>Connected with this fact, and to be borne in mind
by those not called upon to elucidate art scientifically,
is the further fact, which I have analogically pointed
out, when I said that every individual has in the Past
affinities, possibilities of spiritual satisfaction differing
somewhat from those of every other. It is well
that we should try to enlarge those possibilities; and
we must never make up our mind that a picture,
statue, piece of music or poetry, says little to us until
we have listened to its say. But although we strive to
make new friends, let us waste no further time on such
persons as we have vainly tried to make friends of; and
let each of us, in heaven's name, cherish to the utmost
his natural affinities. There are persons to whom, for
instance, Botticelli can never be what he truly is to
some of their neighbours: the very quality which gives
such marvellous poignancy of pleasure to certain temperaments
causing almost discomfort to others; and
similarly about many other artists, representing very
special conditions of being, and appealing to special
conditions in consequence. High Alpine air, sea-water,
Roman melting westerly winds, so vitalising, so soothing
to some folk, are mere worry, or fever, or lassitude
to others, without its being correct to say that one set
of persons is healthy and the other morbid: each
being, in truth, healthy or morbid just in proportion as
it realises its necessities of existence, fitting equally
into the universe providing it be fitted each into the
proper piece thereof.</p>

<p>On the other hand (and this, rather than <i>filiations of
schools</i> and <i>influences</i> of artistic <i>milieus</i>, it were well we
should know), it becomes daily more empirically certain,
and will some day doubtless become scientifically
obvious, that there are works of art which awaken
such emotion that they can be delectable only to
creatures with instincts out of gear and perception
upside down; while there are others, infinitely more
plentiful, which, in greater or lesser degree, must delight
all persons who are sane, as all such are delighted
by fine weather, normal exercise, and kindly sympathy;
and, <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, that as these wholesome works of art
merely bore or actually distress the poor morbid exceptions,
so the unwholesome ones sicken or harrow
the sound generality; the world of art, moreover, like
every other world, being best employed in keeping
alive its sound, not its unsound, clients.</p>

<p>Such works of art, such artists of widest wholesome
appealingness, there are in all periods of artistic development;
more in certain fortunate moments, say the
Periklean age and the early sixteenth century, than in
others; and most perhaps in certain specially favoured
regions&mdash;in Attica during Antiquity, and during painting
times, in the happy Venetian country. These we
all know of; but by the grace of Nature, which creates
men occasionally so fortunately balanced that their
work, learned or unlearned, must needs be fortunately
balanced also, they arise sometimes in the midst of
mere artistic worry and vexation of spirit, or of artist
bleakness, perfect like the almond and peach trees,
which blossom, white and pink, on the frost-bitten
green among the sapless vines of wintry Tuscan hills;
and to some natures, doubtless, these are more pleasant
and health-giving than more mature or mellow summer
or autumnal loveliness. But, as I have said, each must
find his own closest affinities in art and history as in
friendship.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>III</h3>

<p>There are some more things, and more important,
still to be said, from the reader's standpoint rather
than the writer's, about the influence on our lives of
the Past and of its art, and more particularly of the
vague period called the Renaissance.</p>

<p>When the Renaissance began to attract attention,
some twenty or twenty-five years ago, there happened
among English historians and writers on art, and among
their readers, something very similar to what had happened,
apparently, when the Englishmen of the sixteenth
century first came in contact with the Italian
Renaissance itself, or whatever remained of it. Their
conscience was sickened, their imagination hag-ridden,
by the discovery of so much beauty united to so
much corruption; and, among our latter-day students
of the Renaissance, there became manifest the same
morbid pre-occupation, the same exaggerated repulsion,
which is but inverted attraction, which were rife
among the playwrights who wrote of <i>Avengers</i> and
<i>Atheists</i>, Giovannis and Annabellas, Brachianos and
Corombonas, and other <i>White Devils</i>, as old Webster
picturesquely put it, <i>of Italy</i>. Indeed, the second discovery
of the Renaissance by Englishmen had spiritual
consequences so similar to those of the first, that in an
essay written fifteen years ago I analysed the feelings
of the Elizabethan playwrights towards Italian things
in order to vent the intense discomfort of spirit which
I shared assuredly with students older and more competent
than myself.</p>

<p>This kind of feeling has passed away among writers,
together with much of the fascination of the Renaissance
itself. But it has left, I see, vague traces in the
mind of readers, rendering the Renaissance a little distasteful
(and no wonder) to the majority; or worse,
a little too congenial to an unsound minority; worst
of all, tarnishing a little the fair fame of Art; and
as a writer now turned reader, I am anxious to deliver,
to the best of my powers, other readers from this
perhaps inevitable but false and unprofitable view of
such matters.</p>

<p>The conscience of writers on history and art has
long become quite comfortable about the Renaissance;
and the Websterian or (in some cases John Fordian)
phenomenon of twenty years ago been forgotten as a
piece of childish morbidness. Does this mean that the
conscience has become hardened, that evil has ceased
to repel us, or that beauty has been accepted calmly
as a pleasant and necessary, but somewhat immoral
thing? Very far from it. Our conscience has become
quieter, not because it has grown more callous, but
because it has become more healthily sensitive, more
perceptive of many sides, instead of only one side of
life. For with experience and maturity there surely
comes, to every one of us in his own walk of life, a
growing, at length an intuitive sense that evil is a
thing incidentally to fight, but not to think very much
about, because if it is evil, it is in so far sporadic,
deciduous, and eminently barren; while good, that is
to say, soundness, harmony of feeling, thought, and
action with themselves, with others' feeling, thought,
and action, and with the great eternities, is organic,
fruitful and useful, as well as delightful to contemplate.
Hence that the evil of past ages should not concern us,
save in so far as the understanding thereof may teach
us to diminish the evil of the Present. In any case,
that evil must be handled not with terror, which
enervates and subjects to contagion, but with the
busy serenity of the physician, who studies disease for
the sake of health, and eats his wholesome food after
washing his hands, confident in the ultimate wholesomeness
of nature.</p>

<p>And in such frame of mind the corruption of the
Renaissance leaves us calm, and we know we had
better turn our backs on it, and get from the Renaissance
only what was good. Only, if we are physicians,
or more correctly (since in a private capacity
we all are) only <i>when</i> we are physicians, must we
handle the unwholesome. Meanwhile, if we wish to
be sound, let us fill our soul with images and emotions
of good; we shall tackle evil, when need be,
only the better. And here, by the way, let me open
a parenthesis to say that, of the good we moderns
may get from occasional journeys into the Past,
there is a fine example in our imaginary and emotional
commerce with St. Francis and his joyous theology.
For while other times, our own among them,
have given us loftier morality and severer good sense,
no period save that of St. Francis could have given us
a blitheness of soul so vivifying and so cleansing. For
the essence of his teaching, or rather the essence of his
personality, was the trust that serenity and joyfulness
must be incompatible with evil; that simple, spontaneous
happiness is, even like the air and the sunshine
in which his beloved brethren the birds flew
about and sang, the most infallible antidote to evil,
and the most sovereign disinfectant. And because we
require such doctrine, such personal conviction, for the
better living of our lives, we must, even as to better
climates, journey forth occasionally into that distant
Past of medi&aelig;val Italy; and as to the Ezzelinos,
Borgias, and Riarios, and the foul-mouthed humanists,
good heavens! why should we sicken ourselves with
the thought of this long dead and done for abomination?</p>

<p>So much for the history of the Renaissance and the
good it can be to us. Now as to the art. That
more organic mode of feeling and thinking which
results in active maturity, from the ever-increasing
connections between our individual soul and the surrounding
world; that same intuition which told us that
historic evil was no subject for contemplation, does also
admonish us never to be suspicious of true beauty, of
thoroughly delightful art. Nay, beauty and art in any
case; for though beauty may be adulterated, and art
enslaved to something not itself, be sure that the element
of beauty, the activity of art, so far as they are
themselves specific, are far above suspicion even in the
most suspicious company. For even if beauty is united
to perverse fashions, and art (as with Baudelaire and
the decadents) employed to adorn the sentiments of
maniacs and gaol-birds, the beauty and the art remain
sound; and if we must needs put them behind us, on
account of too inextricable a fusion, we should remember
it is as we sometimes throw away noble ore,
for lack of skill to separate it from a base alloy. As
regards the nightmare anomaly of perfect art arisen
in times of moral corruption, those unconscious analogies
I have spoken of, and which perhaps are our
most cogent reasons, have taught us that such anomalies
are but nightmares and horrid delusions. For,
taking the phenomenon historically, we shall see that
although art has arisen in periods of stress and change,
and therefore of moral anarchy, it has never arisen
among the immoral classes nor to serve any immoral
use: the apparent anomaly in the Renaissance, for
instance, was not an anomaly, but a coincidence of
contrary movements: a materially prosperous, intellectually
innovating epoch, producing on the one hand
moral anarchy, on the other artistic perfection, connected
not as cause and effect, but as coincidence, the
one being the drawback, the other the advantage, of
that particular phase of being. The Malatestas and
Borgias, of whom we have heard too much, did not
employ Alberti and Pier della Francesca, Pinturicchio
and Bramante, to satisfy their convict wickedness,
but to satisfy their artistic taste, which, in so far, was
perfectly sound, as various others among their faculties,
their eye and ear, and sense of cause and effect,
were apparently sound also. And the architecture of
Alberti, the decorations of Pinturicchio, remain as
spotless of all contact with their evil instincts as the
hills they may have looked at, the sea they may have
listened to, the eternal verity that two and two make
four, which had doubtless passed through their otherwise
badly inhabited minds. And, moreover, the sea
is still sonorous, the mountains are still hyacinth
blue, and the buildings and frescoes still noble, while
the rest of those disagreeable mortals' cravings and
strivings are gone, and on the whole were best forgotten.</p>

<p>But there is another side of this same question, and
of it we are admonished, as it seems to me, still louder
by our growing intellectual instincts&mdash;those instincts,
let us remember, which do but represent whatever has
been congruous and uniform in repeated experience.
Art is a much greater and more cosmic thing than the
mere expression of man's thoughts or opinions on any
one subject, of man's attitude towards his neighbour
or towards his country, much as all this concerns us.
Art is the expression of man's life, of his mode of being,
of his relations with the universe, since it is, in fact,
man's inarticulate answer to the universe's unspoken
message. Hence it represents not the details of his
existence, which, more's the pity, are rarely what they
should be, whether in thought or action, but the bulk
of his existence, <i>when that bulk is unusually sound</i>.
This clause contains the whole philosophy of art. For
art is the outcome of a surplus of human energy, the
expression of a state of vital harmony, striving for and
partly realising a yet greater energy, a more complete
harmony in one sphere or another of man's relations with
the universe. Now if evil is a non-vital, deciduous, and
sterile phenomenon <i>par excellence</i>, art must be necessarily
opposed to it, and opposed in proportion to art's vigour.
While, on the other hand, the seeking, the realisation
of greater harmony, whether harmony visible, audible,
thinkable, and livable, is as necessarily opposed to
anomaly and perversity as the great healthinesses of
air and sunshine are opposed to bodily disease. Hence,
in whatever company we find art, even as in whatever
company we find bodily health and vigour, let us
understand that <i>in so far as truly art</i>, it is good and a
source of good. Let us never waver in our faith in
art, for in so doing we should be losing (what, alas!
Puritan contemners of art, and decadent defilers
thereof, are equally doing) much of our faith in
nature and much of our faith in man. For art is the
expression of the harmonies of nature, conceived and
incubated by the harmonious instincts of man.</p>

<p>I have given the influence of St. Francis as an
example of what added strength our modern soul may
get by a sojourn in the Past. What our soul may get
of similar but more sober joy may be shown by another
example from that wonderful Umbrian district, one of
the earth's oases of spiritual rest and refreshment.
Among all the sane and satisfying art of the Renaissance,
Umbria, on the whole, has surely grown for us the
highest and the holiest. I am not speaking of the fact
that Perugino painted saints in devout contemplation,
nor of their type of face and expression. Whatever his
people might be doing, or if they were not people at
all, but variations only of his little slender trees or
distant domes and steeples, his art would have been
equally high and holy. And this because of its effect,
direct, unreasoning, on our spirit, making us, while we
look, live with a deeper, more devoutly joyful life.
What the man Perugino was, in his finite dealings with
his clients and neighbours, has mattered nothing in the
painting of these pictures and frescoes; still less what
samples of conduct he was shown by the ephemeral
magnificos who bought his works.</p>

<p>The tenderness and strength of the medi&aelig;val Italian
temper (as shown in Dante when he is human, but above
all in Francis of Assisi) has been working through
generations toward these paintings, interpreting in its
spirit, selecting and emphasising for its meaning the
country in all the world most naturally fit to express
it; and thus in these paintings we have the incomparable
visible manifestation of a perfect mood: that
wide pale shimmering valley, circular like a temple, and
domed by the circular vault of sky, really turned, for
our feelings, into a spiritual church, wherein not
merely saints meditate and Madonnas kneel, but ourselves
in deepest devout happiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Thoughts such as these bring with them the memory
of the master we have recently lost, of the master who,
in the midst of &aelig;sthetical anarchy, taught us once more,
and with subtle and solemn efficacy, the old Platonic
and Goethian doctrine of the affinity between artistic
beauty and human worthiness.</p>

<p>The spiritual evolution of the late Walter Pater&mdash;with
whose name I am proud to conclude my second,
as with it I began my first book on Renaissance matters&mdash;had
been significantly similar to that of his own
Marius. He began as an &aelig;sthete, and ended as a
moralist. By faithful and self-restraining cultivation
of the sense of harmony, he appears to have risen from
the perception of visible beauty to the knowledge of
beauty of the spiritual kind, both being expressions of
the same perfect fittingness to an ever more intense
and various and congruous life.</p>

<p>Such an evolution, which is, in the highest meaning,
an &aelig;sthetic phenomenon in itself, required a wonderful
spiritual endowment and an unflinchingly discriminating
habit. For Walter Pater started by being above
all a writer, and an &aelig;sthete in the very narrow sense
of twenty years ago: an &aelig;sthete of the school of Mr.
Swinburne's <i>Essays</i>, and of the type still common on the
Continent. The cultivation of sensations, vivid sensations,
no matter whether healthful or unhealthful, which
that school commended, was, after all, but a theoretic
and probably unconscious disguise for the cultivation
of something to be said in a new way, which is the
danger of all persons who regard literature as an end,
and not as a means, feeling in order that they may
write, instead of writing because they feel. And of
this Mr. Pater's first and famous book was a very clear
proof. Exquisite in technical quality, in rare perception
and subtle suggestion, it left, like all similar
books, a sense of caducity and barrenness, due to the
intuition of all sane persons that only an active synthesis
of preferences and repulsions, what we imply in
the terms <i>character</i> and <i>moral</i>, can have real importance
in life, affinity with life&mdash;be, in short, vital; and
that the yielding to, nay, the seeking for, variety and
poignancy of experience, must result in a crumbling
away of all such possible unity and efficiency of living.
But even as we find in the earliest works of a painter,
despite the predominance of his master's style, indications
already of what will expand into a totally different
personality, so even in this earliest book, examined
retrospectively, it is easy to find the characteristic
germs of what will develop, extrude all foreign admixture,
knit together congruous qualities, and give us
presently the highly personal synthesis of <i>Marius</i> and
the <i>Studies on Plato</i>.</p>

<p>These characteristic germs may be defined, I think,
as the recurrence of impressions and images connected
with physical sanity and daintiness; of aspiration
after orderliness, congruity, and one might almost say
<i>hierarchy</i>; moreover, a certain exclusiveness, which is
not the contempt of the craftsman for the <i>bourgeois</i>,
but the aversion of the priest for the profane uninitiated.
Some day, perhaps, a more scientific study
of &aelig;sthetic phenomena will explain the connection
which we all feel between physical sanity and
purity and the moral qualities called by the same
names; but even nowadays it might have been prophesied
that the man who harped upon the clearness
and livingness of water, upon the delicate bracingness
of air, who experienced so passionate a preference for
the whole gamut, the whole palette, of spring, of temperate
climates and of youth and childhood; a person
who felt existence in the terms of its delicate vigour
and its restorative austerity, was bound to become, like
Plato, a teacher of self-discipline and self-harmony.
Indeed, who can tell whether the teachings of Mr.
Pater's maturity&mdash;the insistance on scrupulously disciplined
activity, on cleanness and clearness of thought
and feeling, on the harmony attainable only through
moderation, the intensity attainable only through
effort&mdash;who can tell whether this abstract part of his
doctrine would affect, as it does, all kindred spirits if
the mood had not been prepared by some of those
descriptions of visible scenes&mdash;the spring morning
above the Catacombs, the Valley of Sparta, the paternal
house of Marius, and that temple of &AElig;sculapius with
its shining rhythmical waters&mdash;which attune our whole
being, like the music of the Lady in <i>Comus</i>, to modes of
<i>sober certainty of waking bliss</i>?</p>

<p>This inborn affinity for refined wholesomeness made
Mr. Pater the natural exponent of the highest &aelig;sthetic
doctrine&mdash;the search for harmony throughout all orders
of existence. It gave the nucleus of what was his
soul's synthesis, his system (as Emerson puts it) of
rejection and acceptance. Supreme craftsman as he
was, it protected him from the craftsman's delusion&mdash;rife
under the inappropriate name of "art for art's
sake" in these uninstinctive, over-dextrous days&mdash;that
subtle treatment can dignify all subjects equally, and
that expression, irrespective of the foregoing <i>impression</i>
in the artist and the subsequent <i>impression</i> in the
audience, is the aim of art. Standing as he did, as all
the greatest artists and thinkers (and he was both) do,
in a definite, inevitable relation to the universe&mdash;the
equation between himself and it&mdash;he was utterly unable
to turn his powers of perception and expression
to idle and irresponsible exercises; and his conception
of art, being the outcome of his whole personal mode
of existence, was inevitably one of art, not for art's
sake, but of art for the sake of life&mdash;art as one of the
harmonious functions of existence.</p>

<p>Harmonious, and in a sense harmonising. For, as
I have said, he rose from the conception of physical
health and congruity to the conception of health and
congruity in matters of the spirit; the very thirst for
healthiness, which means congruity, and congruity
which implies health, forming the vital and ever-expanding
connection between the two orders of phenomena.
Two orders, did I say? Surely to the
intuition of this artist and thinker, the fundamental
unity&mdash;the unity between man's relations with external
nature, with his own thoughts and with others'
feelings&mdash;stood revealed as the secret of the highest
&aelig;sthetics.</p>

<p>This which we guess at as the completion of Walter
Pater's message, alas! must remain for ever a matter of
surmise. The completion, the rounding of his doctrine,
can take place only in the grateful appreciation of his
readers. We have been left with unfinished systems,
fragmentary, sometimes enigmatic, utterances. Let us
meditate their wisdom and vibrate with their beauty;
and, in the words of the prayer of Socrates to the
Nymphs and to Pan, ask for beauty in the inward soul,
and congruity between the inner and the outer man;
and reflect in such manner the gifts of great art and
of great thought in our soul's depths. For art and
thought arise from life; and to life, as principle of
harmony, they must return.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many years ago, in the fulness of youth and ambition,
I was allowed, by him whom I already reverenced
as a master, to write the name of Walter Pater on the
flyleaf of a book which embodied my beliefs and hopes
as a writer. And now, seeing books from the point of
view of the reader, I can find no fitter ending to this
present volume than to express what all we readers
have gained, and lost, alas! in this great master.</p>

Cathedral of Assisi, a very early medi&aelig;val building, affords a
singular instance of the meeting of the last remnant of that serene
symbolism of Roman and Byzantine-Roman churches with the usual
Lombard horrors. A fine passion-flower or vine encircles the porch,
peacocks strut and drink from an altar, while, on the other hand, lions
mangle a man and a sheep, and horrible composite monsters, resembling
the prehistoric plesiosaurus, bite each other's necks. A Madonna
and Christ are enthroned on Byzantine seats, the weight resting on
human beings, not so realistically crushed as those of Ferrara and
Milan, but suffering. There is a similar meeting of symbols in the
neighbouring Cathedral of Foligno; and, so far as I could see, the
Umbrian valley is rich in very early churches of this type, sometimes
lovely in ornamentation, like S. Pietro of Spoleto, sometimes very rude,
like the tiny twin churches of Bevagna.</small></p>
